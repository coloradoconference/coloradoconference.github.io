The 8th annual Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative
Methods is scheduled from March 28 - April 2, 2002. As in
previous even-numbered years, a Special Issue of J.
Scientific Computing (SISC) is planned. We seek those
interested in submitting papers, with a deadline of May 1,
2004, for submissions to this special issue.

<p>
This single issue will be dedicated to recent progress in
iterative methods.

<p>
Those unable to attend the conference are strongly urged to
submit papers, as well. All interested should either submit
electronically or send five copies to the SIAM office,
following SIAM's standard submission procedures. (See <a
href="http://www.siam.org/esubs/esisc.htm">
http://www.siam.org/esubs/esisc.htm</a> for further details
on electronic submission and <a
href="http://www.siam.org/journals/instruct.htm">
http://www.siam.org/journals/instruct.htm</a> for further
details on hard copy submission.)

<p>
Whether electronic or hard copy, the author MUST clearly
indicate in either the electronic submission form or in the
cover letter that the paper is being submitted to the SISC
Copper Mountain Special Issue. Papers submitted after the
May 1 deadline may not be considered for the special issue,
at the discretion of the SI Editor-in-Chief, Henk van der
Vorst.
