Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to student
and new Ph.D.  authors judged to have the best research
papers. Any student or new PH.D. whose degree was awarded
after Jan 1, 2003, is eligible to submit a paper.  Papers
containing original research due mainly to the student must
be received before Jan. 10, 2004. The student must be the
primary author and the paper may be no more than 10 pages
