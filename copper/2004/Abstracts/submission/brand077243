===ABSTRACT:
We present a new preconditioner for the iterative solution of 
systems of equations arising from discretisations of systems of 
first order partial differential equations on structured grids. 
Such systems occur in many important applications, including 
compressible fluid flow and electromagnetic wave propagation.

The preconditioner is a truncated convolution operator, with a 
kernel that is a fundamental solution of a difference operator 
closely related to the original discretisation. We give an 
FFT-based algorithm for computing fundamental solutions.

Analysis of a relevant scalar model problem in two spatial 
dimensions shows that grid independent convergence is obtained 
using a simple one-stage iterative method.

As an example of a more involved problem, we consider the steady 
state solution of the non-linear Euler equations in a two 
dimensional, narrowing channel. We present results from numerical 
experiments, verifying that the preconditioning technique again 
achieves grid independent convergence, both for an upwind 
discretisation and for a centred second order discretisation with 
fourth order artificial viscosity.
