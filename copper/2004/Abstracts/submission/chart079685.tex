Considerable efforts in recent multigrid research have concentrated on
algebraic multigrid schemes. A vital aspect of this work is uncovering
algebraically smooth error components in order to construct effective
multigrid components. Adapative or self-correcting multigrid schemes
expose algebraically smooth error, analyze the effectiveness of the
resulting multigrid algorithm and adjust the cycling as needed in order
to improve the rate toward convergence. This talk will discuss an
adaptive multigrid method that uses relaxation and subcycling on
complementary grids as an evaluative tool in correcting multigrid
cycling. The particular implementation of this idea manages smooth error
in a manner analogous to spectral AMGe. Numerical results will be
included.
