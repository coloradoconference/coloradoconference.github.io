===ABSTRACT:

It is well known that the convergence of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm for solving  
symmetric positive definite systems $Ax=b$ depends on 
the eigenvalue distribution of the iteration matrix. 
For a wide class of problems, 
the presence of isolated eigenvalues at the extreme of the spectrum slows down the convergence
significantly. In this circumstance, the rate of convergence of CG can be greatly improved 
if components of the
residual in the directions of eigenvectors associated to the isolated eigenvalues
are deflated by means of a suitable preconditioner.
Several adaptive preconditioning techniques have been proposed in the past few years 
that attempt to tackle this problem efficiently~[3,~4]. The preconditioner $M$
has generally the form of a low-rank matrix update, and is constructed using spectral information
extracted from the coefficient matrix;
the spectral information can be computed in advance, prior to the
iterative solution, or gathered over the iterations from the Lanczos process.


In this talk, we perform a preliminary study on the effect of the accuracy
of the eigencomputation on the quality of the spectral preconditioning;
in our study, we consider in particular the spectral preconditioner 
proposed in~[1,~2].
The analysis is based on the perturbation theory, and leads us to
proposing a  criterion for screening
the spectral information in the design of the preconditioner.
In particular, we extend this analysis to the case
of solving a sequence of linear systems involved in a non-linear process, like those
arising in Gauss-Newton process.
We show results of numerical experiments from data assimilation 
problems in oceanography to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach 
in a real-life application.
