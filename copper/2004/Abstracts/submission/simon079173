===ABSTRACT:
Newton's method is at the core of many algorithms used for 
solving nonlinear equations.  A globalized Newton method is 
an implementation of Newton's method intended to enhance the 
likelihood of convergence to a solution from an arbitrary 
initial guess.  A Newton-GMRES method is an implementation of 
Newton's method in which  GMRES is used to solve approximately 
the linear system that characterizes the Newton step.  A 
globalized Newton-GMRES method combines both globalization 
procedures and the GMRES scheme to develop robust and efficient 
algorithms for solving nonlinear equations.  The aim of this 
talk is to present the results of a numerical study 
aimed at evaluating the relative merits of several globalized 
Newton-GMRES methods on large-scale 2D and 3D problems 
involving the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations.  This work 
is joint with Roger Pawlowski, John Shadid, and Homer Walker.
