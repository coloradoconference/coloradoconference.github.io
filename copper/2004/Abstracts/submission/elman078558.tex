In this study, we describe the algebraic computations required to
implement the stochastic finite element method for solving problems in
which uncertainty is restricted to right hand side data coming from
forcing functions or boundary conditions.
We show that the solution can be represented in a compact outer product
form which leads to efficiencies in both work and storage, and we
demonstrate that block iterative methods for algebraic systems with
multiple right hand sides can be used to advantage to compute this
solution.
We also show how to generate a variety of statistical quantities from the
computed solution.
Finally, we examine the behavior of these statistical quantities in one
setting derived from a model of acoustic scattering.
