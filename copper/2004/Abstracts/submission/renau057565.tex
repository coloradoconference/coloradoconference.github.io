A novel parallel method for determining an approximate
total least squares (TLS) solution is introduced. Based on domain
distribution, the global TLS problem is partitioned into several
dependent TLS subproblems. A convergent algorithm using the parallel
variable distribution technique (Ferris and Mangasarian, 1994) is
presented. Numerical results support the development and analysis of the
algorithms.
