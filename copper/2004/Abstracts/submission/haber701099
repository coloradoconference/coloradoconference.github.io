===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we describe a multigrid method for Quasi-Static
Maxwell's equations with highly discontinuous coefficients. 
Our method is based on OcTree discretization of the system, 
coupled with a reformulation of the discrete system. 
The OcTree allows us to effectively  build  coarse grids 
that do not cross discontinuities while the reformulation
effectively deals with the null space of the
bf curl. We demonstrate that using this approach we are able 
to solve problems that cannot be solved by any other multigrid 
method known to us.
