Newton's method is at the core of many algorithms used for
solving nonlinear equations. A globalized Newton method is
an implementation of Newton's method intended to enhance the
likelihood of convergence to a solution from an arbitrary
initial guess. A Newton-GMRES method is an implementation of
Newton's method in which GMRES is used to solve approximately
the linear system that characterizes the Newton step. A
globalized Newton-GMRES method combines both globalization
procedures and the GMRES scheme to develop robust and efficient
algorithms for solving nonlinear equations. The aim of this
talk is to present the results of a numerical study
aimed at evaluating the relative merits of several globalized
Newton-GMRES methods on large-scale 2D and 3D problems
involving the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. This work
is joint with Roger Pawlowski, John Shadid, and Homer Walker.
