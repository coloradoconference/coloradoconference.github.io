DIRECT is a global optimization algorithm that can be effective in
solving medium sized, noisy "black-box" problems with multiple local
minima. In this talk, we will describe DIRECT, and present some new
nonsmooth analysis of the algorithm. We will also discuss improvements to
DIRECT that have been guided by the analysis.
