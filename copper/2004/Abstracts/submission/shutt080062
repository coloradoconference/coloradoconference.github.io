===ABSTRACT:
We consider parallel, scalable software packages for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. More specifically, we focus on developing software for block preconditioning using
methods dervied from the pressure projection and Kay, Loghin, Silvester, Elman, and Wathen (KLESW) preconditioner families.
Meros, a suite of N-S specific block preconditioners,is developed using TSF, a high-level block matrix manipulation language. After presenting the design rationale, some preliminary results using meros on problems from a realistic fluid flow code (MPSalsa) are presented. Comparisons between preconditioning strategies from the pressure projection (Simple) and KLESW families will be shown.
