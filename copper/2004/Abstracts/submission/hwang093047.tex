We propose and test a new two-level nonlinear additive Schwarz
preconditioned inexact Newton algorithm(ASPIN). The two-level
nonlinear preconditioner combines a local nonlinear additive
Schwarz preconditioner and a global {\it linear} coarse
preconditioner. This approach is more attractive than the
two-level method introduced in Cai et al. (2002), which is nonlinear on
both levels. Since the coarse mesh function evaluation only requires the
solution of a linear coarse system rather than a nonlinear coarse system
derived from the discretization of original partial differential
equations, the overall computational cost can be reduced considerably.
Our parallel numerical results
based on a driven cavity incompressible flow problem show that the
new two-level ASPIN is nearly scalable with respect to the number
of processors, the fine mesh size, and Reynolds number, provided
that the coarse mesh size is fine enough.
