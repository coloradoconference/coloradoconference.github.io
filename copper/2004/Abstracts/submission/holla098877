===ABSTRACT:
Sparse approximate inverses are a popular choice of preconditioner especially for use in a parallel environment, due to the high degree of parallelizability in both their construction and application.  This is certainly true when the preconditioner, $P$, is calculated by minimizing $\|I-PA\|_{F}$ via the solution of independent linear least squares problems for the rows separately. 

In this talk we will consider generalizations of such preconditioners, which maintain this attractive feature: firstly through use of an alternative norm, and secondly via the use of `target matrices'.  The former has been discussed previously though it appears not to have been exploited.  The second and main focus here will be on readily inverted target matrices, $T$, which form part of a preconditioner when $\|T-PA\|$ is minimized.  We will discuss two varieties of target matrices, and show results when a target matrix is used in the solution of advection-diffusion problems.
