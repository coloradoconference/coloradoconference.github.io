\begin{abstract}
Optimized Schwarz preconditioning is applied to a spectral element method
for the modified Helmholtz equation and pseudo-Laplacian arising in
incompressible flow solvers.  The preconditioning is performed on an
element-by-element basis. The method enables one to use non-overlapping
elements, yielding an effective algorithm in terms of communication
between elements and implementation. Two approaches are tested. The first
consists of constructing a $P_1$ finite element problem on each
overlapping element. In the second, the preconditioner is applied 
directly on a non-overlapping spectral element. Numerical results demonstrate
an improvement in the iteration count over the classical Schwarz algorithm.
