===ABSTRACT:
In this talk a class of algebraic preconditioners, based on the concept of (smoothed) aggregation, is introduced. The resulting 
procedure, that does not require geometric information, is completely  algebraic and well-suited for parallel computations on  unstructured grids in two and three dimensions. This technique is described in the context of a simple elliptic model problem with convergence estimates and numerical experiments presented. The procedure is then applied as a preconditioner to our coupled systems of interest in a Newton-Krylov solution procedure.

In the context of Navier-Stokes with coupled heat and mass transfer, we present parallel and algorithmic scaling studies on large-scale distributed memory parallel computers.  Comparisons are reported with 1-level domain decomposition preconditioners, and with two-level domain decomposition preconditioners with coarse grids.
