===ABSTRACT:
Density functional based electronic structure calculations
have become the most heavily used approach in materials science to
calculate materials properties with the accuracy of a full quantum
mechanical treatment of the electrons. This results in an approximate
single particle form of the Schrodinger equation which is an
eigenfunction problem.
In this talk I will present a brief introduction to density functional
theory and electronic structure calculations followed by a discussion
of the iterative eigensolvers we have developed for these problems.
I will discuss and compare the performance of a few different solvers,
such as conjugate gradient based methods,
on large parallel computers for a variety of physical problems.
I will also discuss some of the eigenvalue problems associated
with newer electronic structure methods for studying large nanosystems.
