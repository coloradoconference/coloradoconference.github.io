===ABSTRACT:
 Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is an effective solver for many of the large,
 sparse linear systems arising from the discretization of PDEs.  There
 remain, however, large classes of problems for which the classical AMG
 heuristics, based on the concepts of "strength of connection" and
 "algebraic smoothness", break down, yielding suboptimal performance.
 Recent efforts attempt to overcome such difficulties by adaptively
 constructing the components of an AMG algorithm.  We present an adaptive AMG coarsening algorithm based on compatible relaxation along with preliminary numerical results.

 This work is an ongoing collaboration with Marian Brezina, Tom
 Manteuffel, Scott MacLachlan, Steve McCormick, and John Ruge at CU
 Boulder, Oren Livne at Stanford, and Rob Falgout at CASC-LLNL.
