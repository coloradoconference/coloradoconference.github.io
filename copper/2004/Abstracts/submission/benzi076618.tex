In this talk we will report recent results on the use of
the Hermitian/skew-Hermitian Splitting (HSS) preconditioner
for generalized saddle point problems. Theoretical results
on the spectral properties of preconditioned matrices, including
sharp bounds on the eigenvalues and conditions for a
real spectrum, will be highlighted (joint work with
Gene Golub and with Valeria Simoncini).

Numerical results on fluid flow problems and from a novel
application in image processing (weighted Toeplitz least squares)
will be given (joint work with Jia Liu and Michael Ng).
