We consider the $F_p$ preconditioners proposed by Kay \& Loghin and
Silvester, Elman, Kay \& Wathen for the linear systems associated with
solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These $F_p$ methods
require the construction of a convection-diffusion operator projected
onto the pressure space (denoted $F_p$). Numerous theoretical and
numerical studies have demonstrated mesh independent convergence and the
overall efficacy of the approach.

In this talk, we address a potential drawback of the $F_p$
preconditioners: the required construction of $F_p$ by the application.
While most incompressible flow codes have the primary kernels needed for
building $F_p$, its actual construction can still pose a significant
burden to many large scale parallel simulation codes. As an alternative,
we consider automatic ways of computing $F_p$ based on sparse approximate
inverses and the notion that operators in the Schur complement often
nearly commute. An algorithm (SPAC) is given for constructing $F_p$
automatically and numerical comparisons are performed to demonstrate that
favorable convergence properties are retained.
