===ABSTRACT:
Newton-Krylov methods for nonlinear PDEs employ Krylov-subspace 
solvers for the linear systems generated at each Newton iteration. 
The matrix-vector products required by the linear solver are 
frequently obtained via finite-difference approximations to 
directional derivatives, without ever generating the matrix.
The common experience is that these Jacobian-free methods only work 
for computationally expensive linear solvers, such as GMRES, but fail 
for Lanczos-based iterations, such as TFQMR.
In this talk, we discuss the reasons for the failure of
Lanczos-based iterations, propose remedies, and present the
results of some numerical experiments.
