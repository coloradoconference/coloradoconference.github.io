In this talk we will study block preconditioners
based on the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and symmetric
Gauss-Seidel block algorithms for two alternative
formulations of the Bidomain equations, that
model the electrical activity in the heart.
Numerical experiments and theoretical
results show that the two formulations behave differently
with respect to the different algorithms. Some, but
not all of the algorithms are order optimal with respect
to the spatial and the time discretization parameters.
