Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is an effective solver for many of the large,
sparse linear systems arising from the discretization of PDEs. There
remain, however, large classes of problems for which the classical AMG
heuristics, based on the concepts of "strength of connection" and
"algebraic smoothness", break down, yielding suboptimal performance.
Recent efforts attempt to overcome such difficulties by adaptively
constructing the components of an AMG algorithm. We present an adaptive
AMG coarsening algorithm based on compatible relaxation along with
preliminary numerical results.

This work is an ongoing collaboration with Marian Brezina, Tom
Manteuffel, Scott MacLachlan, Steve McCormick, and John Ruge at CU
Boulder, Oren Livne at Stanford, and Rob Falgout at CASC-LLNL.
