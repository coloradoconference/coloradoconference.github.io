We consider a special coarse space definition for an algebraic
multilevel preconditioner using matching in graphs. The convergence of
the resulting multilevel method will be discussed. Although not fully
optimal, the method has some attractive properties, such as:
preserving the sparsity of the coarse level matrices and preserving
the M-matrix property. The convergence estimate relays on the
stability of suitable projections onto the coarse spaces. Such
stability estimate will be derived using a new approach, namely, the
commuting properties of these projections with discrete (graph) analogue of the gradient.
