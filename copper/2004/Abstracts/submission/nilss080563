===ABSTRACT:
In this work we study a preconditioned iterative method for some higher order time discretizations of parabolic problems.
The preconditioner is optimal with respect to spatial 
discretization parameters and time stepping parameters.
We use Pad\'{e} approximations of the exponential function to
discretize in time. Standard preconditioners for low order
time discretization schemes, such as Crank-Nicolson and implicit Euler, can be reused as preconditioners for the arising systems. We present both theoretical and numerical results.
