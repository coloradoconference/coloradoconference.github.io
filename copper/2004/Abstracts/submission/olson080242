===ABSTRACT:
One problematic aspect of using high-order discretizations is the often delicate issue of solving the resulting system of equations in an iterative context.  We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell's Equation.  High-order spectral elements are used in a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) setting resulting in a possibly indefinite system of equations.  We utilize the symmetry in the method and study several preconditioning schemes in a Krylov subspace setting.  We propose strategies to effectively handle this problem and offer preliminary numerical results in support.
