===ABSTRACT:
We conduct simulations for the 3D unsteady state anisotropic diffusion process in 
the human brain by discretizing the governing diffusion 
equation on Cartesian grid and adopting a high performance 
differential-algebraic
equation (DAE) solver, the parallel version of 
implicit differential-algebraic (IDA) solver,
to tackle the resulting large scale system of DAEs. 
Parallel preconditioning techniques
including sparse approximate inverse and banded-block-diagonal preconditioners
are used with the GMRES method to accelerate the 
convergence rate of the iterative
solution. We then investigate and compare the efficiency and 
effectiveness 
of the two parallel preconditioners. The computational results of the diffusion simulations on a parallel supercomputer show that the sparse approximate inverse preconditioning strategy,
which is robust and efficient with good scalability,
gives a much better overall
performance than the banded-block-diagonal preconditioner.
