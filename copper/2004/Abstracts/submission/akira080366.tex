Parallel implementation of vector processing for sparse matrix
algorithms is a critical problem on shared memory architectures
with finite memory bandwidth.
In this study, we evaluate the performance and the scalability of the
conjucate gradient type algorithm applied for the computation of a
few extreme eigenpairs of large scale sparse eigenproblems and its
preconditioners, originally
proposed and implemented by Knyazev and Argentati, on various architectures.
