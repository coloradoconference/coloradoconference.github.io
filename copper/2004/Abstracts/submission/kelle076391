===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we discuss aspects of two algorithms for 
a class of parameter-dependent
compact fixed point problems. If the compactness is a result
of the use of a short-time temporal integration as a nonlinear
preconditioner, we show how the rate of convergence of the
linear iteration in a Newton-Krylov method is related to the
dimension of the inertial manifold. We then 
discuss some observations on construction of multilevel methods 
that accurately resolve turning points and asymptotes for such
problems.
