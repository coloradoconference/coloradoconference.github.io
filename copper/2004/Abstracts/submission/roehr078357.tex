A projection multilevel method is developed for direct treatment of the
nonlinearity for two-dimensional elliptic partial differential equation
systems. The nonlinearity is assumed to be of the type \(u \partial v\),
which includes the Navier-Stokes equations as an important
representative. Using a first-order system least squares (FOSLS) approach
and introducing a new variable for \( \partial v \), we obtain a
formulation in which the nonlinearity appears as a product of two
different variables. The result is a system that is linear within each
variable but nonlinear in the cross terms. The design of the projection
method allows us to treat the nonlinearity directly, without
linearization. We report on theory and numerical experiments that show
its efficiency.
