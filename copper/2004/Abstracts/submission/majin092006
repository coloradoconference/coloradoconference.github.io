===ABSTRACT:
In this paper, the general framework of cascading
multigrid methods is studied. As an application, the cascading
multigrid methods are applied to the heat equation with mild
regularity in Besov spaces. Furthermore we analyze a cascading
multigrid method for the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin
method.
