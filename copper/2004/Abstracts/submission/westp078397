===ABSTRACT:
Many elliptic boundary value problems have the fortunate property of a guaranteed smooth solution as long as the data and domain are smooth. However, many problems of interest are posed in nonsmooth domains and, as a consequence, lose this property at the boundary. In this talk we consider problems that have nonsmooth solutions at ``irregular boundary points", that is, points that are corners of polygonal domains, locations of changing boundary condition type, or both.

Least-squares discretizations in particular suffer from a global loss of accuracy due to the reduced smoothness of the solution.  We investigate a weighted-norm least squares method that recovers optimal order accuracy in the weighted functional norm and weighted $H^1$ norm, and retains $L^2$ convergence even near the singularity.  The method requires only {\em a priori} knowledge of the power of the singularity, not the actual singular solution.  The theory of this general technique is studied in terms of a simplified div-curl system and shown to be similarly effective when applied to other problems.
