In this talk, we present a nested preconditioning technique for solving
nonsymmetric saddle-point problems. In particular, we consider those
saddle-point problems that arise from the numerical solution of the mixed
finite element discretization of particulate flows - flow of solid
particles in incompressible fluids.
These indefinite linear systems are solved using a preconditioned Krylov
subspace method with an indefinite preconditioner. This
creates an inner-outer iteration in which the inner iteration is handled
via a preconditioned Richardson scheme.
We provide an analysis of our approach that relates the convergence
properties of the three nested iterations. Also, ``optimal" approaches
are proposed for the construction of the preconditioner
of the inner Richardson iteration.
The analysis is validated by numerical experiments that demonstrate the
robustness of our nested iteration scheme, its lack of sensitivity to
changes in the fluid-particle system, and its
``scalability".
