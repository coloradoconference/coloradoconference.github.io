Parallel BoxMG is an implementation of Dendy's black box multigrid
algorithm that is based on MPI, and is geared toward distributed memory
parallel computers. The computational workhorse in this multigrid scheme
is an efficient parallel line relaxation for 2D BoxMG. In 3D parallel
BoxMG, 2D parallel BoxMG is used as a parallel plane relaxation, which
employs parallel line relaxation as its core computational routine. In
our talk, we will give a review of parallel line relaxation algorithms,
and introduce our efficient version of it. We will further show how to
efficiently incorporate this line relaxation into a parallel plane
relaxation.
