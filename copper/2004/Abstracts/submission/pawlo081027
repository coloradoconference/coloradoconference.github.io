===ABSTRACT:
Designing a nonlinear solver library with the flexiblity to support
multiple applications with robust, cutting-edge algorithms presents a
number of difficulties.  Not only must the library supply a large
number of solution algorithms, but it must also account for the many
application specific optimizations that production-level codes
require.  This presentation will discuss the design of NOX, an
object-oriented C++ library being developed to support applications at
Sandia National Laboratories.  We will discuss the design requirements
that the nonlinear solver library must meet and how NOX handles those
issues. Specifics we plan to address include:

1. Desiging a flexible environment to allow for the efficient
introduction of new algorithms.
2. Defining a flexible methodology for convergence and failure
criteria of the nonlinear algorithms (and allowing users to supply
their own criteria).
3. Abstracting the linear solvers and the linear algebra storage
format from the nonlinear algorithm.  This allows applications to use
their own specialized algorithms for optimal performance.
4. Allowing users to pass objects/arguments through the code efficiently.
5. Library portability.

Examples will be presented from large-scale engineering applications
developed at Sandia National Laboratories including reacting flows
(MPSalsa), compressible flows (Premo), and electrical circuit modeling
(Xyce).  Comparisons of the nonlinear globalization algorithms will
also be briefly discussed.
