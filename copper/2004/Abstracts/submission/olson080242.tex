One problematic aspect of using high-order discretizations is the often
delicate issue of solving the resulting system of equations in an
iterative context. We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell's Equation.
High-order spectral elements are used in a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
setting resulting in a possibly indefinite system of equations. We
utilize the symmetry in the method and study several preconditioning
schemes in a Krylov subspace setting. We propose strategies to
effectively handle this problem and offer preliminary numerical results
in support.
