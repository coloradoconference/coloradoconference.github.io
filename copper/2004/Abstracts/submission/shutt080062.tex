We consider parallel, scalable software packages for solving the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. More specifically, we focus on
developing software for block preconditioning using
methods dervied from the pressure projection and Kay, Loghin, Silvester,
Elman, and Wathen (KLESW) preconditioner families.
Meros, a suite of N-S specific block preconditioners,is developed using
TSF, a high-level block matrix manipulation language. After presenting
the design rationale, some preliminary results using meros on problems
from a realistic fluid flow code (MPSalsa) are presented. Comparisons
between preconditioning strategies from the pressure projection (Simple)
and KLESW families will be shown.
