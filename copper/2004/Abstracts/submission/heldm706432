===ABSTRACT:
We present a new multi-level  approach for non-linear image registration using
local refinement techniques.

Standard  multi-level  approaches  for  this  problem  discretize  the  domain
starting  with a  regular coarse  grid  and refine  every cell  from level  to
level.  In our approach,  we also  start with  a regular  coarse grid  but its
refinement  for higher  levels is  done  locally.  Using  local refinement  is
motivated by  the observation  that changes in  the solution at  higher levels
appear mainly localy and large areas stay unchanged such that there is no need
for  a finer  resolution. The  local  refinement in  our approach  is done  by
subdividing  cells  into  four  (2D)  or  eight (3D)  resulting  quad  (2D)  and
octree-grids (3D), respectively.

Compared  with   the  standard  multi-level  approach,   our  method  requires
substantially  less memory  and arithmetic  operations.  Therefore,  it  is in
particular well-suited for large-scale problems.
