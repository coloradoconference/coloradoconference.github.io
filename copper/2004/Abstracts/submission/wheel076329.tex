Multiphysics couplings can happen in different ways. One may have
different physical processes (e.g. flow, transport, reactions) occurring
within the same physical domain, or one may have different physical
regimes (e.g., surface/subsurface environments, fluid/structure
interactions) interacting through interfaces. We will discuss both of
these types of multiphysics couplings in this presentation. Of particular
interest will be the development of interpolation/projection algorithms
for projecting physical quantities from one space/time grid to another,
and the investigation of mortar and mortar-free methods for coupling
multiple physical domains.
