For many optimization problems arising in science and engineering, the
function being optimized depends on the results of a complex
simulation. In these situations, derivative information is often
unavailable or extremely difficult to obtain. For such problems, we
propose the use of Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search (APPS), a
direct search optimization method. APPS has been used successfully on
applications ranging from design of forging processes to
transmembrane protein structure prediction to wild fire simulation parameter
identification. In this talk, we discuss a new APPS algorithm and the
associated software, APPSPACK 4.0. The new algorithm can handle bound
constraints and has an optional zero-order sufficient decrease
condition. The software can be run in serial or parallel and works
with stand-alone programs or scripts for computing the value of the
objective function.
