Newton-Krylov methods for nonlinear PDEs employ Krylov-subspace
solvers for the linear systems generated at each Newton iteration.
The matrix-vector products required by the linear solver are
frequently obtained via finite-difference approximations to
directional derivatives, without ever generating the matrix.
The common experience is that these Jacobian-free methods only work
for computationally expensive linear solvers, such as GMRES, but fail
for Lanczos-based iterations, such as TFQMR.
In this talk, we discuss the reasons for the failure of
Lanczos-based iterations, propose remedies, and present the
results of some numerical experiments.
