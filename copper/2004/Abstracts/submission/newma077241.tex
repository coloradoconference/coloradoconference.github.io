We discuss a high order projection scheme for time integration
of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The method is based on a projection onto the subspace of
divergence-free (incompressible) functions interleaved with
a Krylov-based exponential time integration.

These time integration methods provide a high order accurate,
stable approach with many of the advantages of explicit methods,
and can reduce the computational resources over implicit methods.
We present numerical examples to support our claims and provide
comparison against a Crank Nicolson scheme.
