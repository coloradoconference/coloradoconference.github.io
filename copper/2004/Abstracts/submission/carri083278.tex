Zathras is a computer code that solves the nonequlibrium radiation
diffusion equations. The current time integration method is based on
operator splitting. With the operator splitting method implicit solution
of one or more parabolic systems is required on each time step. The
original matrix solution method was point-Jacobi preconditioned conjugate
gradient. Results will be presented from a work in progress where new
preconditioning options are being considered. The list of potential
preconditioners include, algebraic multigrid, box multigrid, additive
Schwarz
without overlap (Block Jacobi) and a two-level Schwarz method without
overlap which is additive on the fine level and multiplicative between
levels. Comparisons between the different preconditioners will be
presented for multidimensional simulations in parallel.
