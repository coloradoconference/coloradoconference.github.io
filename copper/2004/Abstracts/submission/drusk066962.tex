We obtain simple explicit formulas for the sensitivity of the Lanczos
recursion to small perturbations of the spectrum. The sensitivity is
computed as a quadratic form of the unperturbed eigenvectors. The
derivation is based on a connection between Lanczos and discrete
Gelfand-Levitan methods (described in an unpublished manuscript of
Natterer, 1989). The formulas are valid for both symmetric and
nonsymmetric problems. With the help of our analysis we show
uniform stability of the symmetric Lanzcos recursion and the Inverse Jacobi
Eigevalue Problems (in weak discrete norms) to the
perturbations of the eigenvalues relative to their separations.
This result is a byproduct of our analysis of optimal grids for variable coefficients.
