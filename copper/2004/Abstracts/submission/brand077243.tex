We present a new preconditioner for the iterative solution of
systems of equations arising from discretisations of systems of
first order partial differential equations on structured grids.
Such systems occur in many important applications, including
compressible fluid flow and electromagnetic wave propagation.

The preconditioner is a truncated convolution operator, with a
kernel that is a fundamental solution of a difference operator
closely related to the original discretisation. We give an
FFT-based algorithm for computing fundamental solutions.

Analysis of a relevant scalar model problem in two spatial
dimensions shows that grid independent convergence is obtained
using a simple one-stage iterative method.

As an example of a more involved problem, we consider the steady
state solution of the non-linear Euler equations in a two
dimensional, narrowing channel. We present results from numerical
experiments, verifying that the preconditioning technique again
achieves grid independent convergence, both for an upwind
discretisation and for a centred second order discretisation with
fourth order artificial viscosity.
