By using matrix methods for polynomial root-finding and exploiting matrix
structure, we devise a QR-like algorithm that uses linear time per
iteration, preserving the robustness and rapid convergence of the
classical QR iteration. We also explore the converse reduction of the
eigenproblem to polynomial root-finding without computing the
coefficients and obtain some promising results.
