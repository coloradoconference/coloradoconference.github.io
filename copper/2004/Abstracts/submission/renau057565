===ABSTRACT:
A novel parallel method for determining an approximate
total least squares (TLS) solution is introduced. Based on domain distribution, the global TLS problem is partitioned into several
dependent TLS subproblems. A convergent algorithm using the parallel variable distribution technique (Ferris and Mangasarian, 1994) is presented. Numerical results support the development and analysis of the algorithms.
