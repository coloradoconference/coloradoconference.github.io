===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we present  
a class of algorithms
for the parallel numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in both simulation
and optimization problems.
The algorithm can be considered as an improved version of inexact Newton methods through
the use of nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning, adaptive step-length for line search, and  adaptive  merit functions. 
In addition, 
we couple 
the Krylov stopping conditions with the quality of the Newton direction with respect to the merit functions.
Because of the flexibility on the overlapping size, the type of restrictions, the number of levels, 
and the inexactness of the subdomain solvers, Schwarz preconditioners constitute a key
element for the overall robustness and scalability of our proposed algorithm.
We report computational results for some two-dimensional flows described by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with 
different combinations of Reynolds numbers, grid sizes and number of processors.
