===ABSTRACT:
We consider the application of the conjugate gradient method to
the solution of large symmetric, indefinite linear systems.
Special emphasis is put on the use of constraint preconditioners
and a new factorization that can reduce the number of flops
required by the preconditioning step. Results concerning the
eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix and its minimum
polynomial are given. Numerical experiments validate these
conclusions.
