===ABSTRACT:
We investigate the use of Neumann expansion in generating sparsity patterns
in computing parallel sparse approximate inverse (SAI) preconditioners. This
is implemented in the framework of multistep successive
sparse approximate inverse preconditioning (MSP) strategies.
Numerical experiments with the new sparsity pattern
selection strategy are compared with
the original MSP strategies. Their
advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
