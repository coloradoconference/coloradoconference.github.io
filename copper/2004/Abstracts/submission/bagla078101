===ABSTRACT:
Augmenting the Krylov subspace with Ritz vectors has proven 
to be an efficient and equivalent implementation of Sorensen's 
(1992)Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi (IRA) method for solving 
eigenvalue problems. We have applied the method of augmenting 
to develop a block Householder eigenvalue algorithm and a SVD 
algorithm. For the eigenvalue problem, we have developed a 
block Householder implicitly restarted Arnoldi method. This method maintains strong orthogonality and utilizes level 3 BLAS 
matrix-matrix products. Restarting is implemented by augmentation of Krylov subspaces. The SVD algorithm computes a sequence of partial Lanczos bidiagonalizations of A with judiciously chosen initial vectors. Restarting is also implemented by augmentation of Krylov subspaces. Both methods were derived by adapting Wu and Simon's (2001) approach for solving symmetric eigenvalue problems. MATLAB codes are available for both methods.
