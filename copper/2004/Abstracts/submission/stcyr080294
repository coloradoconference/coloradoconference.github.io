===ABSTRACT:
\begin{abstract}
Optimized Schwarz preconditioning is applied to a spectral element method
for the modified Helmholtz equation and pseudo-Laplacian arising in
incompressible flow solvers.  The preconditioning is performed on an
element-by-element basis. The method enables one to use non-overlapping
elements, yielding an effective algorithm in terms of communication
between elements and implementation. Two approaches are tested. The first
consists of constructing a $P_1$ finite element problem on each
overlapping element. In the second, the preconditioner is applied 
directly on a non-overlapping spectral element. Numerical results demonstrate
an improvement in the iteration count over the classical Schwarz algorithm.  

\nonindent {\bf Introduction}
The classical Schwarz algorithm uses Dirichlet transmission conditions
between subdomains. By introducing a more general Robin boundary
condition, it is possible to optimize the convergence characteristics
of the original algorithm (Charton et al. 1991; Chevalier et al. 1998; Gander et al 2002; Gander 2003). In this work, a study of
the model equations $u - \Delta u = f$ and pseudo-Laplacian arising
in incompressible flow solvers is performed.  As suggested by the work
of Fischer et al. (2000), the preconditioning is either implemented via a $P_1$
finite element formulation of the original problem build on the spectral
element grid, or directly by solving a smaller spectral element problem
without overlap on each spectral element.
Although traditional Schwarz preconditioning combined with a coarse
grid solver is quite efficient, the need for even more powerful
preconditioning techniques stems from atmospheric modeling. Recently
(see Thomas and Loft 2002; St-Cyr and Thomas 2004), a semi-implicit SEM was combined with
OIFS time stepping, enabling time steps on the order of
20 times the advective CFL condition (Xiu and Karniadakis 2001). This directly reflects
as a significant increase in the number of conjugate gradient iterations
required to perform the semi-implicit step.
