We present a new multi-level approach for non-linear image registration using
local refinement techniques.

Standard multi-level approaches for this problem discretize the domain
starting with a regular coarse grid and refine every cell from level to
level. In our approach, we also start with a regular coarse grid but its
refinement for higher levels is done locally. Using local refinement is
motivated by the observation that changes in the solution at higher levels
appear mainly localy and large areas stay unchanged such that there is no need
for a finer resolution. The local refinement in our approach is done by
subdividing cells into four (2D) or eight (3D) resulting quad (2D) and
octree-grids (3D), respectively.

Compared with the standard multi-level approach, our method requires
substantially less memory and arithmetic operations. Therefore, it is in
particular well-suited for large-scale problems.
