My presentation discusses the eigenvalue problem in structural dynamics.
In particular, my goal will be to discuss recent work on scalable
eigensolvers that can be used on large-scale problems arising from 3D FEM
discretizations. These solvers include gradient methods such as LOBPCG,
(Block)DACG, BRQMIN and block implementations of inexact Newton methods
such as Jacobi-Davidson and Davidson.
