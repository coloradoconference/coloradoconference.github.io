===ABSTRACT:
Stochastic modeling of two-dimensional steady and unsteady
diffusion equations in presence of uncertainties in the 
diffusivity field, forcing term and/or boundary conditions 
is considered, using spectral expansions.  Diffusivity and 
source fields, as well as the boundary conditions, are 
stochastic processes which are first represented using
their respective Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions. When 
truncated, the KL expansions involve a finite set of independent 
random variables that multiply the eigen-modes of the 
correlation kernels of the corresponding processes. 
Propagation and quantification of the impact of these 
uncertainties on the solution is performed by means of a
Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion, whose spectral coefficients are
determined using a Galerkin approach.  The Galerkin projection 
leads to a set of coupled problems for the PC 
coefficients of the solution which are functions of space and 
time.  Spatial finite-difference discretization of these coupled 
problems results in a large system of equations, whose dimension 
necessitates the use of iterative approaches in order to obtain 
the solution within a reasonable computational time.  
To accelerate the convergence of the iterative technique, a 
multigrid method, based on spatial coarsening, is implemented.  
Numerical experiments show good scaling properties of
the method, both with respect to the number of spatial grid points 
and the stochastic resolution level.
