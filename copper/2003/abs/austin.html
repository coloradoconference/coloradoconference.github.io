<p>
The displacement formulation of linear elasticity yields a system of 
equations in which the grad-div operator is the dominant term in the 
incompressible limit.  A similar operator also arises when using 
least-squares techniques to pose the linear Boltzmann equation as a
minimization problem.  When using a standard FE discretization (using linear
FEs) and a standard multigrid method (using pointwise smoothing) for either
system, non-robust convergence results will be observed in the multigrid method 
as the grad-div operator becomes dominant.   The prescription to 
overcoming this insufficient performance is to use a FE space with a 
sizable divergence-free subspace and the proper relaxation operator.  
In this talk, we investigate using different orders of polynomials to 
discretize the problem and a group smoothing approach to reduce 
divergence-free error in the multigrid routine.
