<p>
The ingredients for attaining textbook multigrid efficiency in solution of 
CFD problems
are discussed as they arise in application to stagnation flow problems. The 
ingredients include principal linearization, factorizable schemes,
local relaxation, etc. Textbook multigrid efficiency is demonstrated for 
stagnation flows
with a pressure-equation formulation of the incompressible fluid equations.
Both inviscid and viscous flows over a range of Reynolds number are 
considered.
Convergence of algebraic errors below discretization errors in one full 
multigrid cycle is
attained using flow-dependent relaxation schemes.
The residual convergence rates for the systems are the same as for scalar 
elliptic
equations on the same grid.
