<p>
The  quality of  numerical simulations  of processes  that are  modeled
by  partial  differential  equations  strongly depends  on the  quality
of the  mesh  that is used  for their  discretization. This  quality is
affected,  for example,  by mesh  smoothness,  or discretization error.
To improve  the mesh,  a functional  that is in general  nonlinear must
be minimized  (for example,  the $L^2$ approximation  error on the mesh).
This  minimization  is constrained by  the validity of  the mesh, since
no mesh folding is allowed. Classical techniques, such as nonlinear CG,
perform very  poorly on this  class of  minimization problems.  We will
introduce a  new minimization  technique that  utilizes the  underlying
geometry  of  the problem.  By coarsening the mesh  successively,  in a
multilevel-like  fashion,  minimizing  appropriate  coarse grid quality
measures,  and  interpolating  finer meshes from  coarser ones,  a more
rapid movement of fine mesh points results, and the overall convergence
of the minimization procedure is accelerated.
