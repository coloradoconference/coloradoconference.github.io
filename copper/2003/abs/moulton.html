<p>
In many application areas the diffusive component offers a significant
challenge because it is characterized by a discontinuous diffusion
coefficient with fine-scale anisotropic spatial structure; moreover,
the underlying grid may be severely distorted.  Thus, increasingly
Mixed and Mixed-Hybrid discretizations (e.g., Support Operator
Methods, and Mixed-Hybrid finite element methods) are employed because
they explicitly enforce important physical properties of the problem,
such as mass balance.  However, these discretizations are based on the
first order form, and hence, naturally lead to an indefinite linear
system.  Thus, the primary hurdle in the widespread adoption of these
methods has been the robust and efficient solution of this linear
system.

In the mixed-hybrid case it is possible to eliminate the flux (i.e.,
the vector unknowns) locally to obtain a sparse symmetric positive
definite system.  Unfortunately, the nonstandard sparsity structure of
this reduced system has posed a significant challenge for the design
of efficient multigrid preconditioners.  In this presentation we
compare two different approaches to preconditioning these systems.
First, we consider a mimetic approach to developing alternative or
approximate discretizations that generate reduced systems that have a
sparsity structure amenable to existing robust multigrid solvers.  In
contrast, we consider the direct application of variational
coarsening, the robust but potentially costly technique that lies at
the heart of most robust multigrid algorithms.  Both of these
techniques have been used to generate a number of preconditioners for
orthogonal grids, as well as distorted logically rectangular grids.
We will discuss the varying degrees of robustness associated with
these preconditioners, as well as their potential extension to
unstructured grids.
