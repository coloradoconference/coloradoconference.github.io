<p>
The two-level algebraic preconditioner with projectors has been 
proposed in [1] for symmetric positive definite stiffness matrices. 
The underlying grid is partitioned into non-overlapping substructures
of arbitrary shapes (grid subdomains, superelements or simply original 
grid cells). A projector to the kernel of a subdomain stiffness matrix 
is build for each subdomain. A coarse grid matrix is an approximation 
to the original stiffness matrix in the space of images of the projectors. 
If the original stiffness matrix is a finite element approximation of an 
elliptic operator, the coarse grid matrix describes connections between 
integral averages a discrete function over subdomains.

<p>
In the talk we shall prove the convergence of the two-level scheme for
the case of elliptic operators. We shall show that the convergence rate
is independent of jumps in coefficients between subdomains. A multilevel 
preconditioner based on the two-level scheme will be studied numerically
for the case of highly distorted meshes and strongly varying coefficients.
In comparison with a few other multilevel preconditioners, it 
demostrates robust behavior over a much bigger class of problems [2].
