<p>
A new program for the solution of elliptic partial differential equations,
PHAML, has recently been released.  PHAML stands for Parallel Hierarchical
Adaptive MultiLevel.  It is written in Fortran 90, and compiles to a library
of routines to be called by the application program.  The primary routine
solves an elliptic boundary value or eigenvalue problems using finite elements
with bisection adaptive refinement of triangles, a hierarchical multigrid
solver, and distributed memory message passing parallelism with MPI or PVM.
Examples illustrate how the program can be used to solve parabolic problems,
nonlinear problems and systems of equations.  Optional additional libraries
that PHAML can make use of include OpenGL for graphics, Zoltan for grid
partitioning, and PETSc for linear system solvers, through which PHAML provides
an environment for experimenting with different methods.  In this talk, we
will describe the design and use of the PHAML software.  PHAML can be obtained
at http://math.nist.gov/phaml.
