<br>Abstract
</center>
<p>
Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) has been shown to be a very effective solver
for standard finite-difference and finite-element discretizations of
a wide range of second-order elliptic PDEs. This talk covers some
of the issues related to the use of AMG on discretizations using
higher-order finite elements.  These include: problems encountered when
no special handling is used; variations of the AMG algorithm better
suited for such problems; the effect of the choices of basis
functions; and measures of accuracy versus work for various orders
of approximation. Numerical results are reported.
