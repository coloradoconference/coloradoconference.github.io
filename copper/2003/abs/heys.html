     Abstract </center>
               
<p>Numerous mathematical models for the mechanical coupling&nbsp; between
  a moving fluid and an elastic solid have been developed. &nbsp;The models
  are inherently nonlinear because the shape of the Eulerian fluid domain
is not known <i>a priori</i> -- it is at least partially determined by the
displacement of the elastic solid. Different iteration techniques have been
developed to solve the nonlinear system of equations. &nbsp;For example,
one approach is to iteratively solve the fluid equations on a fixed domain,
apply the fluid stresses from the fluid solution to an elastic solid, and
remap the fluid domain based on the displacement of the elastic solid.&nbsp;
At the other extreme, the full system of equations (fluid, elastic, and mapping/meshing) 
 can be solved simultaneously using a Newton iteration. &nbsp;There are advantages 
 and disadvantages to each approach, and the choices effect the performance 
 of the solver (AMG) and the accuracy of the solution differently.<br>
    The performance of different iteration techniques will be presented for 
 a model of a linear elastic solid coupled to a Newtonian fluid using a FOSLS
 formulation. &nbsp;In  this approach, the system of non-linear partial differential
 equations is  recast as a linearized first-order system of equations, and
 the solution is found using least  squares minimization principles.  A finite
 element discretization of the FOSLS formulation results in a SPD matrix
problem  that is solved using AMG. &nbsp;With AMG, only a single Newton iteration
is required for each refinement beyond the course grid to achieve an accurate
discrete solution on the fine grid. &nbsp;However, the convergence rate of
the AMG cycles depends on the iteration technique.<br>
