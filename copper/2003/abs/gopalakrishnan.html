Hybridization of mixed methods for the Dirichlet problem by
introduction of Lagrange multipliers is the preferred way of
implementing the mixed method for compelling theoretical and practical
reasons.  We introduce a new variational characterization of the
Lagrange multiplier equation arising from hybridization.  This result
has several applications, but its applications in constructing
preconditioners will be our main focus. We will begin by examining the
conditioning of this equation when no preconditioner is used. Then we
will establish certain spectral equivalences which allow construction
of a Schwarz preconditioner for the Lagrange multiplier equation.
Although preconditioners for the lowest order case of the hybridized
Raviart-Thomas method have been constructed previously by exploiting
its connection with a nonconforming method, our approach is different
in that we use the new variational characterization. This allows us to
precondition even the higher order cases of these methods. Among other
applications of the characterization result, is a previously
unsuspected relationship between the Raviart-Thomas and the
Brezzi-Douglas-Marini methods, e.g., we show that when these methods
are used to approximate harmonic solutions, they yield identical
Lagrange multipliers.
