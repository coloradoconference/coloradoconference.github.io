<p>
Meshfree discretizations construct approximate solutions to
partial differential equation based on particles, not on meshes, 
so that it is well suited to solve the problems on irregular domains.
Since the nodal basis property is not satisfied in meshfree 
discretizations, it is difficult to handle essential boundary
conditions. 
There has been attempts to enforce this property by modifying basis 
functions. Instead, we employ the Lagrange multiplier approach to 
resolve this problem, but this will result in indefinite linear systems. 

As a solver for this indefinite linear system, we propose a new
Algebraic 
Multigrid (AMG) scheme based on aggregating elements and  
neighborhoods. AMG based only on aggregation of elements was tried 
because of its simplicity, but it often shows slow convergence. 
There have been many attempts to overcome this problem.
The new interpolation approach utilizes the information in neighborhood
matrices as well as aggregation of elements. 
Unlike classical AMG, this new approach can be applied to any 
symmetric, positive definite linear systems.

Moreover, with additional information for meshfree discretizations,
we successfully modified this new AMG approach to solve symmetric 
indefinite linear systems arising from meshfree discretizations 
with essential boundary conditions.
