<p>
Considerable efforts in recent multigrid research have concentrated on
algebraic multigrid schemes.  A vital aspect of this work is uncovering
algebraically smooth error components in order to construct effective
multigrid components.  Adapative or self-correcting multigrid schemes
expose algebraically smooth error, analyze the effectiveness of the
resulting multigrid algorithm and adjust the cycling as needed in order to
improve the rate toward convergence. This talk will discuss an adaptive
multigrid method that uses relaxation and subcycling on complementary
grids as an evaluative tool in correcting MG cycling. The particular
implementation of this idea manages smooth error in a manner analogous to
spectral AMGe. Numerical results will be included.
