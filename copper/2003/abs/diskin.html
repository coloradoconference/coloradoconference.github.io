<p>

Multiscale modeling of materials requires simulations 
of multiple levels of structural hierarchy. The computational efficiency
of numerical methods becomes a critical factor for simulating
large physical systems with highly desperate length scales.
A flow with small particles represents a particularly difficult problem for
efficient multigrid solution. These particles are often so small, 
occupying just a few points
on the fine grid, that they cannot be properly incorporated 
into a coarse-grid formulation. Efficiency, i.e., convergence rate,  
of classical multigrid solvers 
deteriorates significantly because of the poor accuracy of coarse-grid
approximations. <br>

In this talk, I am planning to overview and evaluate
several existing multigrid approaches
to solving problems with small particles. A new multigrid method
based on a modified local Galerkin coarsening scheme will be presented.
Numerical tests confirm 
recovering the optimal (Laplace-like) 
efficiency in solution of practically interesting
problems.
