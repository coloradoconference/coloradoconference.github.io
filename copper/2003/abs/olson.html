<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
We develop a least-squares finite element method for linear
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) of hyperbolic type.  This formulation
allows for discontinuities in the numerical approximation and yields a
linear system which can be handled efficiently by Algebraic
Multigrid solvers.  
<br><br>
We pose the classical advection equation as a ``dual''-type problem and
relate the formulation to previous attempts.  Convergence properties and
solution quality for discontinuous solutions are investigated for standard,
conforming finite element spaces on quasi-uniform tessellations of the domain
and for the general case when the flow field is not aligned with the
computational mesh.  Algebraic Multigrid results are presented for the
linear system arising from the discretization and we study the success of
this solver.
