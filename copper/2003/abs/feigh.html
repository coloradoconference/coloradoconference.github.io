<p>
A geometrical multigrid algorithm for vector based formulations
for electromagnetic field problems discretized by the Conformal
Finite Integration Technique is proposed. The transfer operators
and the coarse grid operators are constructed for a hierarchy of
non-nested grids. A validation of the presented approach is
achieved for electro-static and magneto-static test problems for
which a discrete Poisson and a discrete Curl-Curl equation have to
be solved respectively. Experimental results for the asymptotic
complexity and for the convergence characteristics in case of
discontinuous material coefficients are presented.
