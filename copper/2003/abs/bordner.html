	<p>
	  MGMPI (<a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/mgmpi">http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/mgmpi</a>)
	  is a parallel multigrid software library under development
	  at the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics, currently
	  located at the University of California, San Diego. MGMPI is
	  written using a combination of C++ and Fortran-77, and is
	  designed to solve 3D linear elliptic PDEs discretized on
	  logically Cartesian grids.  Parallelism is obtained by
	  partitioning grids into subregions, and using MPI for
          communication between these subregions.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Current multigrid components include V-, W-, and F-cycle
	  methods, operator-based prolongation and restriction,
	  coarse-grid problem generation using harmonic averaging or
	  Galerkin coarsening, and weighted point Jacobi and point
	  red-black Gauss Seidel smoothers.  Coarse-grid problems can
	  be solved using one of a variety of Krylov subspace solvers,
	  including CG and BiCG-STAB, or by applying any of the
          available smoothers.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Future components we hope to implement soon include
	  semi-coarsening, and alternating line- and plane-smoothers.
	  We also intend to include fast computational kernels that
	  exploit properties of multi-level memory hierarchies, and to
	  optimize parallel performance.
