	  <p>
	    Selective multigrid has higher order of interpolation and
	    prolongation operators in comparison with standard aggregative
	    multigrid. These properties provide better convergence rate for
	    selective multigrid but come at price of a longer setup phase. 
	    A question what solver is faster can't be answered without direct
	    comparison of both solvers under a specified convergence criteria.
	    <br>
	    The selective multigrid has been implemented following
	      J.W.Ruge and K.Stueben's works. The standard coarsening
	      scheme was used and the direct 
	    and standard interpolations were tried. The standard
	      interpolation is more exact but more expensive in time
	      and memory.  
	      <br>


	    The convergence and running time of the selective multigrid were
	    compared with that of the Weiss et al's
		aggregative multigrid. Both solvers were applied to a
		test problem based on a diffusivity
		equation and to a few matrices built from a pressure
		equation for some CFD problems. Their performance is
		analyzed based on reduction of 
		residuals by one and six order of magnitude.
