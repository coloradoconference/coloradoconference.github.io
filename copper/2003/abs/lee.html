<p>We shall present a sharp result on the convergence rate of the method of 
successive subspace corrections for singular system of equations. The result 
has been obtained for variational problems on a Hilbert space. Various identities
for the convergence rate are presented especially for multigrid method and domain
decomposition method. Some illustrations of theory are also given for problems
posed on a finite dimensional Hilbert space.
