<p>
We describe a parallel algebraic multigrid method for the solution of 
Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. The underlying formulation
leverages off of an algebraic multigrid scheme for real valued Maxwell
problems. This real valued method uses distributed relaxation 
and a specialized grid transfer operator. The key to this multilevel 
method is the proper representation of the (<b>curl</b>,<b>curl</b>) null 
space on coarse meshes. This is achieved by maintaining certain commuting 
properties of the inter-grid transfers.

<p>
To adapt the real value scheme to complex arithmetic, equivalent
real forms are considered. The complex operator is written
as a 2 x 2 real block matrix system. The real valued multigrid
algorithm can then be used to generate grid transfers which are 
adapted to the equivalent real form of the problem. In order to
complete the scheme a smoother must also be adapted to address
the equivalent real form. We will show how application of the
distributed relaxation idea on the equivalent real form matrix
leads to a nice decoupling of the problem. To complete the method, 
complex polynomial smoothers are developed for use within the 
distributed relaxation process. While some care is required to
develop the polynomials, they work well in parallel
and avoid difficulties associated with parallel Gauss-Seidel.

<p>
Numerical experiments are presented for some 3D problems arising
in geophysical subsurface imaging. The experiments illustrate
the efficiency of the approach on various parallel machines in terms of
both convergence and parallel speed-up.
