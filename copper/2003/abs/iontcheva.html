<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>The finite element discretization of the Signorini's problem leads to 
inequality constrained minimization problem. In this talk we present a nonlinear 
element based algebraic multigrid method with special coarsening away from the 
contact boundary for the solution of this problem. As a smoothing procedure we 
use the Projected Gauss-Seidel algorithm and for the coarse grid solver - a 
modification of the Dostal's algorithm. The performance of the resulting method 
is illustrated by numerical experiments.
