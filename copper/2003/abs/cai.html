<p>
The primitive physical equations for elastic problems and incompressible
Newtonian fluid flows are first-order partial differential systems:
the stress-displacement and the stress-velocity-pressure formulations,
respectively. Traditionally, these first-order systems are converted
into second-order partial differential systems with less variables
through differentiation and elimination. Computations are then based on
these well-known second-order systems. Although substantial progress in
numerical methods and in computations has been achieved, these problems
may still be difficult and expensive to solve.

In this talk, we will first derive the stress-velocity formulation for
incompressible Newtonian fluid flows since the pressure can be represented
in terms of the normal stresses. We will then introduce a least-squares
method applied to the first-order system: the stress-displacement
(velocity) formulation. The principal attractions of our least-squares
method include freedom in the choice of finite element spaces, fast
MULTIGRID solver for the resulting algebraic equations, a practical
and sharp a posteriori error indicator for adaptive mesh refinements at
no additional cost, and the same approaches of spatial discretization
and fast solution solver for both solid and fluid problems.  Numerical
results for a benchmark test problem of planar elasticity will be
presented.
