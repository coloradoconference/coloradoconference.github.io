<p>
With the advent of high performance computers with massively parallel
processors, it has become very important to develop scalable methods
such as AMG. One of AMG's most important components is the smoother.
The most effective smoothers, such as Gauss-Seidel or even multiplicative
Schwarz smoothers are often sequential in nature, whereas Jacobi or
block Jacobi-like smoothers often fail, unless an appropriate smoothing
parameter is used and even then their convergence is often slow. Many
efforts to parallelize Gauss-Seidel have been made. Possible variants
include the use of multi-coloring techniques or hybrid smoothers. 
Multi coloring techniques are difficult to implement and can be inefficient, 
if too many colors are involved, which is often the case on the 
coarser levels on AMG. Hybrid schemes use a sequential smoother on each 
processor, but update in a Jacobi like fashion across processor boundaries, 
and therefore often have similar disadvantages as Jacobi like smoothers.
<p>
In this talk, we investigate the use of relaxation parameters in hybrid
smoothers. We analyze their influence on the smoothing property,
describe a procedure that automatically determines good parameters
on each level of AMG and present numerical results that show
significant improvement over AMG with unrelaxed hybrid smoothers.
