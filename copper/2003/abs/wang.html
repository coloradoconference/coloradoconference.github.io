<p>
Recently a stable pair of finite element spaces for the 
mixed formulation of the plane elasticity system has been 
developed by Arnold and Winther.
Here we construct a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner
for the resulting discrete system.
Essentially, this reduces to finding an efficient
preconditioner for the form 
<i>(<sup>&nbsp.&nbsp</sup>,<sup>&nbsp.&nbsp</sup>)+(div<sup>&nbsp.&nbsp</sup>,div<sup>&nbsp.&nbsp</sup>)</i>
in the symmetric tensor space <i><b>H</b>(div)</i>.
The main difficulty comes from the well known complexity of
building preconditioners for the <i>div</i> operator.
We solve it
by taking a decomposition similar to the Helmholz decomposition.
Both additive and multiplicative preconditioners are studied,
and the conditioner numbers are shown to be 
uniform with respect to the mesh size.
