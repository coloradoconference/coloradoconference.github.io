<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
Substantial effort has been focused over the last two decades
on developing multilevel iterative methods capable of solving the large
linear systems encountered in engineering practice.
These systems often arise from discretizing
partial differential equations over unstructured meshes,
and the particular parameters or geometry of the
physical problem being discretized may be unavailable to the solver.
Algebraic multilevel methods have been of particular interest in this context
because of their promises of optimal performance without the need
for explicit knowledge of the problem geometry.
These methods construct a hierarchy of coarse problems based on the linear
system itself and on certain assumptions about the low-energy components
of the error.
<p>
For smoothed aggregation methods applied to discretizations of elliptic
problems, these assumptions typically consist of knowledge of
the near-nullspace of the weak form.
We describe a recently developed extension of the smoothed aggregation method
in which good convergence properties are achieved in situations where
explicit knowledge of the near-nullspace components may be unavailable.


This extension is accomplished by using the method itself to determine
near-nullspace components when none are provided. The coarsening process is
modified to use and improve the computed components.
<p>
Numerical experiments include test problems arising in
the LANL's hydrocode SAGE, featuring cell-centered discretization,
automatic mesh refinement and coefficient discontinuities.
