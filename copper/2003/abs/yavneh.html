Robust multigrid algorithms for linear boundary-value problems
are well-researched. For nonlinear problems, two general approaches 
are used widely: Global Linearization (GL) and Local Linearization
(LL). In the GL approach, e.g., Newton's method,
the discretized problem is linearized and the resulting linear system is solved
approximately by a (robust) linear multigrid algorithm. This is repeated
iteratively. In the LL approach, the nonlinear fine-grid operator
is approximated nonlinearly on the coarser grids, and
explicit linearization is only performed locally, in the relaxation
process. The best known of the LL methods is the so-called FAS (Full
Approximation Scheme). For simple problems, the two approaches often
perform similarly, but a distinct behavior is exhibited in more
complicated situations, with the GL approach performing better in some 
cases and the LL approach in others.

We propose a Multilevel Nonlinear Method (MNM) which is designed to 
be at least as robust as either one of the classical approaches 
and often more robust than both. A heuristic analysis, supported
by numerical experiments, suggests that MNM indeed yields superior
convergence behavior for difficult nonlinear problems.
