<p>We propose a finite element method for overlapping or
nonmatching grids for the Stokes Problem based on the partition
of unity method. We prove that the discrete inf-sup condition
holds with a constant independent of the overlapping size of the
subdomains. The results are valid for multiple subdomains and any
spatial dimension. </p>
