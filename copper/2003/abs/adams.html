<p>Constrained systems of linear equations (KKT systems) arise in many
applications from contact in solid mechanics and incompressible flow, to
problems in mathematical optimization for PDE systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several
approaches have been developed for solving these systems, given a solver
for the primal part of the system: 1) constraint reduction, 2) projection
methods, and 3) Uzawa/augmented Lagrange.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these methods have
advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uzawa methods are robust and scalable
though they require several approximate solves, as they iterate on the
Shur complement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Constraint reduction is effective for certain types
of constraints, but is limited in its applicability.&nbsp;&nbsp; Projection methods
are attractive as they handle general constraints and are simple to use
with an existing solver or preconditioner, but they are generally not scalable
nor are they robust when used with powerful preconditioners, such as multigrid.
<p>Algebraic multigrid is a popular method for solving the equations that
arise from discretized PDEs, the primal part of KKT systems, but the application
of multigrid to the entire KKT system has not been investigated to a great
degree.&nbsp;&nbsp; V.H. Schulz has recently applied structured geometric multigrid
to optimization problems, S.P. Vanka has developed structured geometric
multigrid techniques for incompressible flow problems, and a commercial
product (TaskFlow) has developed an algebraic (aggregation) multigrid method
for unstructured incompressible flow problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Multigrid methods
are attractive for constrained systems as they have the potential to be
both highly optimal like constraint reduction and general like projection
methods by maintaining tight coupling of the constraints in the preconditioning
process while not requiring that the primal part of the system be augmented
by regularization as in Uzawa methods or a Shur complement as in constraint
reduction.
<p>This talk discusses the application of algebraic multigrid techniques
to discretized PDEs with constraints.&nbsp;&nbsp; We describe a framework for
developing algebraic multigrid methods for KKT systems and discuss coarsening
techniques for the constraint equations.&nbsp;&nbsp; We cover several approaches
to constructing multigrid smoothers and present examples of application
of some of these ideas to contact problems in solid mechanics.
