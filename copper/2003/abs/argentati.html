Abstract

<p>The goal of this project is to
develop a Scalable 
"Preconditioned Eigenvalue Solver"
for the solution of partial eigenvalue problems for large sparse
symmetric matrices on massively parallel computers, taking advantage of
advances in the Scalable Linear Solvers project, in particular in multigrid
technology and in incomplete factorizations (ILU) developed under the HYPRE
project, at the
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/">Center for Applied
Scientific Computing</a> (LLNL-CASC). The solver
allows the utilization of HYPRE preconditioners for symmetric eigenvalue
problems. In this talk we discuss the
implementation approach for a flexible
“matrix free” parallel algorithm, and the capabilities of the developed
software. We also discuss performance on a set of test problems.

<p>The base iterative method that has been implemented is
the <a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~aknyazev/software/CG/">locally
optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG)</a> method described
in: A. V. Knyazev, <u>Toward the Optimal Preconditioned Eigensolver: Locally
Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method</u>, <a
href="http://epubs.siam.org/sam-bin/getfile/SISC/articles/36612.pdf">SIAM
Journal on Scientific Computing 23 (2001), no. 2, pp. 517-541</a>. The
LOBPCG solver finds one or more of the smallest eigenvalues
and the corresponding eigenvectors of
a symmetric matrix. 

<p>The code is written in MPI based C-language and uses HYPRE and LAPACK libraries. It has been tested
with HYPRE version 1.6.0. The user interface to the solver is implemented
using
HYPRE style object oriented function calls. The matrix-vector multiply and the
preconditioned solve are done through user supplied functions. This approach
provides significant flexibility. The implementation illustrates that this
method can successfully and efficiently use parallel libraries. 

<p>The following HYPRE preconditioners have been tested, AMG-PCG, DS-PCG,
ParaSails-PCG, Schwarz-PCG
and Euclid-PCG , in the eigenvalue solver. Partition of processors is
determined by user input consisting of an initial array of parallel vectors.
The code has been mainly developed and tested on a <a
href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/ccm/beowulf/">beowulf cluster at CU Denver</a>. This system
includes 36 nodes, 2 processors per node, PIII 933MHz
processors, 2GB memory per node running Linux Redhat,
and a 7.2SCI Dolpin interconnect. Lobpcg
has also been tested on several LLNL
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/icc/SCF.resources.html">clusters using Compaq and IBM
hardware, running Unix and/or Linux.</a>
