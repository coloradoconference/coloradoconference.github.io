<p>
This paper is devoted to the study of an energy minimizing basis first
introduced by Chan, Smith and Wan in 2000 for algebraic multigrid
methods.  The basis will be first obtained in an explicit and compact
form in terms of certain local and global operators.  The basis
functions are then proven to be locally homonic functions on each
coarse grid ``elememt''.  Using these new results, it is illustrated
that this basis can be numerically obtained in an optimal fashion.  In
addition to the intended application for algebaric multigrid method,
the energy minimizing basis may also be applied for numerical
homogenization.
