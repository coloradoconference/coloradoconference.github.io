We investigate eigensolvers for computing a few of the smallest
eigenvalues of a constrained generalized eigenvalue problem

resulting from the finite element discretization of the time
independent Maxwell equation. We found the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm
(JD) and the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient
(LOBPCG) method to be the most effective factorization-free
algorithms for solving this eigenvalue problem provided that they
are complemented by a powerful preconditioner. We compare various
combinations of hierarchical basis and AMG preconditioners that
improve the convergence rate of the eigensolvers without consuming
memory space excessively. We present numerical results of very large
eigenvalue problems originating from the design of resonant cavities
of particle accelerators that are not reasonably solvable without
the above techniques.
