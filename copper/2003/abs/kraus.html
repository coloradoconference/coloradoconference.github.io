We consider an algebraic multilevel preconditioning method for SPD
matrices resulting from finite element discretization of elliptic PDEs.
The method is based on element agglomeration, and, in particular,
designed for non-M matrices.

Granted that the element matrices at the fine-grid level are given, we
further assume that we have access to some algorithm that performs a
reasonable agglomeration of fine-grid elements at any given level.
The coarse-grid element matrices are simply Schur complements computed
from the locally assembled fine-grid element matrices, i.e., agglomerate
matrices. Hence, these matrices can be assembled to a global approximate
Schur complement.
The elimination of fine-degrees of freedom in the agglomerate matrices
is done without neglecting any fill-in.
This offers the opportunity to construct a new kind of incomplete
LU factorization of the pivot matrix at every level, which is done
by means of a slightly modified assembling process.

Based on these components an algebraic multilevel preconditioner
can be defined for more general SPD matrices. The method can also be
applied to systems of PDEs. A numerical analysis shows its efficiency
and robustness.
