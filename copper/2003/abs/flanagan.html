<p>
We apply multigrid methods for the fast solution of large scale problems
 in Adaptive Optics.
 Adaptive Optics (AO) is a technique for removing the blurring effects in
 optical systems. It has important uses in medical imaging as well as
 astronomical telescopes. In astonomy, AO senses
 incoming light that has been distorted--due to atmospheric
 turbulence--and corrects the distortions using a deformable
 mirror. Of great practical importance is the ability to evaluate the
 linear map from sensor measurements to mirror deformations (called the
 reconstructor matrix) within the 5-10 millisecond time scale of the
 turbulence. For 30+ meter telescopes now being developed, the
 reconstructor matrix will have tens or even hundreds of thousands of
 unknowns.

 In this talk we will describe the special structure of the
 reconstructor matrix, and we will present a multigrid algorithm
 for the fast evaluation of this matrix.  Classically, least squares
reconstruction
 algorithms are used.  We present the model with regularization.  We will
discuss
 issues such as the
sensor/actuator  geometries that affect the performance of the multigrid
algorithm.
Incorporating Kolmogorov statistics into the least squares reconstruction
as a
 regularizing term will be described.
