 </center>

 <p>
 A nonlinear additive Schwarz preconditioned inexact
 Newton method (ASPIN)
 was introduced recently for solving large
 sparse nonlinear systems of equations obtained
 from the discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations,
 and the method has proved numerically to be more robust than the
traditional
 inexact Newton methods, especially for problems with unbalanced
nonlinearities.
 In this talk, we discuss some recent development of ASPIN for
 solving the steady state
 incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the velocity-pressure
formulation.
 The sparse nonlinear system is obtained
 by using a Galerkin least squares finite element discretization on
 two dimensional unstructured meshes.
 The key idea of ASPIN
 is that we find the solution of the original
 system F(u)=0 by solving a nonlinearly preconditioned system G(u)=0
 that has the same solution as the original system, but with more
 balanced nonlinearities. Our numerical results show that
 ASPIN is more robust than the traditional inexact Newton method
 when the Reynolds number is high and when the number of processors is
 large.  In this talk we present some results obtained on
 parallel computers for high Reynolds number flows and compare our
 approach with some inexact Newton method with different forcing terms.
