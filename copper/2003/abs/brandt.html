<p>
The eigenfunctions of a differential operator (or a discretized
differential
operator, or a matrix of a similar type) need not each be separately
represented. A compact multilevel collective structure can be organized,
in
which many eigenfunctions have the same fine-level representation; they
are
distinguished only in the way in which that representation is mollified,

where the mollification is a point-by-pont multiplication by a smooth
function which is represented on the next coarser grid. At that coarser
level, many of the mollification functions can again use a common
representation, etc., so at increasingly coarser levels more and more
eigensets are separated out, each becoming progressively more specific.
<p>
This makes it possible to calculate N eigenfunctions in just O(N log N)
computer operations, using only O(N log N) storage. By comparison, a
usual multigrid eigensolver would require at least O(N**3) operations
and O(N**2) storage. Moreover the multiscale eigenbasis (MEB) structure
allows to expand any given function in terms of the N eigenfunctions in
again just O(N log N) operations. This is a vast generalization of the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which achieves the same complexity order
(with a smaller prefactor), but is limited to the eigenbasis of
differential operators with constant coefficients, periodic boundary
conditions and uniform discretization.
<p>
The multiplicative Galerkin mode of coarsening the eigenproblem avoids
certain flaws in classical multigrid eigensolvers: it yields coarse
equations that have themselves the form of an eigenproblem, whose
eigenvectors correspond one-to-one to fine eigenvectors;
orthogonalizations
need only be performed at coarse levels; and arbitrarily coarse grids
can
be employed even in calculating high eigenfunctions. This mode is
particularly
natural and useful for algebraic multigrid (AMG), since it involves
construction of the intergrid interpolation operators.
<p>
The MEB structure also allows very efficient eigen calculations in
unbounded domains for operators that have asymptotically constant
or periodic coefficients, which is the usual situation in many
applications, including molecular and condensed-matter electronic
structure calculations.
