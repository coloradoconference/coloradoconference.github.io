<p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>direct</i> partial differential problem involves an 
interior differential equation and a set of initial and/or boundary conditions 
which stably determines a unique solution. An<i> inverse</i> problem is one in 
which the differential equation and/or initial and/or boundary conditions are 
not fully given and instead the results of a set of solution observations 
(measurements) are known. They may contain errors, and even without errors the 
problem is usually ill-posed: the known data may be approximated by widely 
different solutions, but the ill-posedness of an inverse problem does not 
necessarily imply  more expensive solution process. On the contrary: once 
the nature of the ill-posedness has been generally understood, to solve an 
inverse problem may even be much less expensive than to solve a corresponding 
direct problem. I am going to demonstrate this methodological point on an 
example of inverse problem for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An EIT 
device for medical use consists of a set of electrodes attached to the chest of 
a patient. A small <i>known</i> current is 
passed between two&nbsp; driver electrodes. In each measurement a current is passed 
through a different electrode pair, while the voltage drops at <i>all </i>the 
electrodes are recorded. The collected data are used in order to compute the 
conductivity distribution in a part of the patient's chest and then to display 
it on a screen in order to detect anomalies, such as tumors. The electrical potential satisfies the equation 
<font face="Symbol">&Ntilde;ª(<font color="#000080">s</font>&Ntilde;</font><i><font face="Times New Roman">u</font></i><font face="Symbol">)=0</font>, where 
<font face="Symbol" color="#000080">s</font> is an electrical conductivity. The 
set of measurements gives ideally (in the limit of many small electrodes and as 
many measurements) the <i>Neumann to Dirichlet</i> mapping: the Dirichlet <i>
<font face="Times New Roman">u</font></i> 
boundary condition resulting from any Neumann <font face="Symbol">¶</font><i><font face="Times New Roman">u</font></i><font face="Symbol">/¶</font><b><font face="Times New Roman">n</font></b> condition. The inverse problem is to evaluate
<font color="#000080" face="Symbol">s</font> from this mapping. 
The conductivity depends on the EIT data in a very weak way. Therefore the 
inverse problem of EIT is ill-posed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There exist some works on numerical methods for the 
relevant problems, but their number is rather sparse and even those papers do 
not consider the question of numerical efficiency, despite its importance for 
applications. In this specific inverse EIT problem, employing local Fourier 
decompositions, we have shown that all conductivity-function components of 
wavelenght <font face="Symbol" color="#000080">l</font> are ill-posed at distances 
<i>r</i>&gt;&gt;<font face="Symbol" color="#000080">l</font> from the 
boundary. Hence there is no need to use at such distances fine solution grids, 
since all we can know about the solution can be calculated with grids whose meshsizes 
increase proportionality to <i>r</i>. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two multigrid solvers 
for this problem are presented:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>first multigrid solver</b> uses the Tikhonov 
regularization technique. The inverse problem is reformulated as a variational 
minimization problem. The resulting Euler equations form a PDE system (for <i>
<font face="Times New Roman">u</font></i>, <font color="#000080" face="Symbol">s</font> and&nbsp; Lagrange multipliers), which makes the problem suitable 
in principle for an effective numerical solution by multigrid methods. The 
multigrid solver starts with large and then procceds to progressively smaller 
regularization parameters. Many features of classical multigrid were adapted to 
this particular problem (such as intergrid communications, boundary condition 
treatment and coarse grid solution).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of a large regularization parameter, 
numerical results demonstrate a good convergence of the developed solver, but 
the obtained solution is too smeared and doesn't approximate the real 
conductivity too well. At small regularization the final approximation is much 
better, especially near the boundary. However, in this case the system is no 
longer elliptic and for efficiency the multigrid solver must use  more 
sophisticated relaxation scheme, which effectively decomposes the system into 
its scalar factors. Although the multigrid cycles assymptotically slow down, the 
final approximation to the <i>conductivity</i> is obtained by just one multigrid 
cycle per grid refinement even for the smallest regularization for which 
solution still exists.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <b>second multigrid solver 
</b>a regularization in the 
classical sense is replaced by <i>a careful choice of grids</i>.
<span style="font-family: David">In order to avoid introducing ill-posed 
components into the current approximation, changes to the solution far from the 
measurements are calculated only on coarse enough grids (with meshsizes at least 
comparable to the distance from the measurements), which only define large-scale
<i>averages </i>of the solution. On the other hand, near the boundary of 
measurements we introduce both high and low oscillatory components to the 
solution. For this we use semi-coarsening in the direction parallel to the 
boundary of measurements and full-coarsening in the perpendicular direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: David">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The algorithm&nbsp; is 
based on three main principles:</span><font face="David"> 1) </font>due to the 
ill-posedness,<span style="font-family: David"> the computational work on the 
grid of meshsize <i>h</i></span><font face="David"> </font>
<span style="font-family: David">should only be done near the boundary, at 
distances <i>O(h)</i></span><font face="David"> </font>
<span style="font-family: David">from it; 2) similar changes introduced into
</span><font color="#000080" face="Symbol">s </font>
<span style="font-family: David">at the different <i>O(h)</i> distances from the 
boundary of measurements cause <i>very different</i> changes in </span><i>
<font face="Times New Roman">u</font></i><span style="font-family: David"> on 
this boundary </span><font face="Symbol">&THORN;</font><span style="font-family: David"> 
for smooth Fourier components in <i>y</i> a full coarsening (both in <i>x</i> 
and <i>y</i>) does not resolve these differences, hence we must use <i>a semi 
coarsening</i> in <i>y </i>direction (i.e. without coarsening the meshsize in 
the <i>x</i> direction); 3) it is necessary to start always from the <i>
better-posed</i> changes </span><font face="Symbol">&THORN;</font><span style="font-family: David"> 
in each cycle (FMG, V-cycle, W-cycle, semi-cycle) we introduce changes to the 
current approximation first on the coarsest (or semi-coarsest) grid, where those 
changes are well-posed, and only after that changes from the finer grids.</span><font face="David">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerical <b>results</b> show that the 
second algorithm approximates <font color="#000080" face="Symbol">s </font><i>
<font face="David">better</font></i> than the regularized method with its many 
artificial parameters (the regularization coefficients, which should change over 
the domain), for less work 
(no Lagrange multipliers). <span style="font-family: David">The accuracy of both algorithm, in 
particular near the boundary of measurements, is nearly the same. But the 
second algorithm does not use any regularization in a classical 
sense, and as a result significant space and time saving is achieved. In this 
algorithm there is no need to solve a large system of discretized differential 
equations and boundary conditions; also, no Lagrange-multiplier equations need 
to be treated.</span><font face="David"> </font>
