<p>
Our discussion concerns SysPFMG, a structured parallel multigrid solver  
for systems of PDEs. SysPFMG uses semi-coarsening
and operator-based interpolation schemes like those in Dendy's
black-box multigrid. The performance of the solver will be tested
on model PDE systems problems, including an elasticity problem. The
performance results will be compared with the expected performance
predicted by local Fourier analysis.
