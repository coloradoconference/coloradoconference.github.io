<p>
In recent years, much work has been done to increase the robustness of
Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods.  The classical AMG method of Ruge
and St&uuml;ben [5] used heuristics based on properties of M-matrices.
Although this algorithm works remarkably well for a wide variety of
problems [3], the M-matrix assumption still limits its applicability.
To address this, a new class of algorithms was developed based on
multigrid theory: AMGe [1], element-free AMGe [4], and spectral AMGe
[2].  All of these algorithms assume a basic framework in their
construction.  Namely, they assume that relaxation is a simple
pointwise method, then they build the coarse-grid correction step to
eliminate the so-called <i>algebraically smooth</i> error left over by
the relaxation process.  In the AMGe methods above, this is done with
the help of a <i>measure</i> (or weak-approximation property) that
defines the approximation property that interpolation must satisfy in
order to achieve uniform convergence assuming a pointwise relaxation.

<p>
In this talk, we introduce a new measure for constructing algebraic
multigrid methods.  The purpose of this new measure is to generalize
the AMG framework to include problems such as Maxwell's Equations,
which has a particularly large null-space when discretized using the
common N&eacute;d&eacute;lec finite elements.  In the old framework,
it is necessary to take all O(N) of these null-space components to the
coarse grid, which results in a non-optimal method.  This problem can
be overcome by using something other than pointwise relaxation to damp
a subspace of these near-null-space components on the fine grid.
Examples include overlapping block relaxation or the so-called
Hiptmair smoother (Brandt's distributive relaxation).  The measure
proposed here takes into account the smoothing process and changes the
AMGe heuristic in a subtle but important way.  The hope is that this
new measure will allow us to develop AMG methods that can handle
difficult problems such as Maxwell's equations or Helmholtz.
