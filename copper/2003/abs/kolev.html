<p>
Finite element problems posed on large unstructured grids arise naturally in 
simulations, where only a very fine discretization of the domain is available. 

In order to achieve performance comparable with multilevel methods for the 
geometrically refined case, one can use an algebraic solver based on sequence of 
coarsened meshes.

<p>
In this talk we present a possible parallelization of one such algorithm - 
the agglomeration based algebraic multigrid for finite element problems (AMGe).

The method starts with a partitioning of the original 
domain into subdomains with a generally unstructured finite element mesh 
on each subdomain. 

The agglomeration based AMGe is then applied independently in each 
subdomain. 

It needs access to the local stiffness matrices which are (variationally) 
constructed after coarsening.

Note that even if one starts with a conforming fine grid, independent 
coarsening generally leads to non-matching grids on the coarser levels. 

We use an element-based dual basis mortar finite element method in order 
to set up global problems on each level.

Since the considered AMGe produces abstract elements and faces 
defined as lists of nodes, the mortar multiplier spaces are also 
constructed in a purely algebraic way. 

This construction requires inversion of the local mass matrices on each 
interface boundary shared between two subdomains, which is possible 
because of the way AMGe agglomerates the faces. 

Finally, a multigrid-preconditioned solver is applied to the resulting 
sequence of (non-nested) spaces. 

The talk will conclude with set of numerical results illustrating the 
computational behavior of this new algebraic multigrid algorithm.
