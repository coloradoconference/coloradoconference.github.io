In this talk, we present an energy minimization approach to constructing
robust interpolation and restriction operators for multigrid for
solving convection dominated problems. Numerical results for PDEs in
1D and 2D, in particular, entering flow and recirculating flow 
problems will be presented.

Multigrid for solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs)
with smooth coefficients has been proven, both numerically and
theoretically, to be a successful and powerful techniques. For PDEs 
whose coefficients are discontinuous or oscillatory, sophisticated
interpolation techniques have been developed, for instance, algebraic
multigrid, black box multigrid, etc. Recently, Wan, Chan and Smith
proposed a robust construction of interpolation operators by
minimizing the energy norm of the coarse grid basis functions subject
to the constraint that the coarse grid basis functions preserve the
null space of the underlying PDE. Fast multigrid convergence is
resulted for several types of nonsmooth coefficient elliptic PDEs on
Cartesian as well as general triangular meshes.

In this talk, we extend the energy minimization approach to non-elliptic
PDEs; specifically, convection diffusion equations. Since the
discretization matrix is nonsymmetric in general, the energy norm
induced by the symmetric positive definite matrix in the case of
elliptic PDEs no longer applicable. In other words, one cannot simply
take the matrix and construct energy minimizing basis function using the
induced matrix norm. Our idea is to construct two sets of
basis functions, one by minimizing the energy norm of the elliptic
operator, and the other set by minimizing the L2 norm, subject to
appropriate constraints. In this way, the norms are well-defined so
that norm minimization makes sense. More importantly, we can capture
the elliptic and hyperbolic parts of the underlying PDE by these
two set of basis functions. Then they are used in defining the interpolation
and restriction operators for multigrid. Numerical results for
solving the entering and recirculating flow problems are presented
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
