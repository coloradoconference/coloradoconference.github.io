<p>Abstract</center>

<p>Numerical solvers for indefinite Helmholtz equations have to deal with
a range of erroneous components which have a slow convergence by standard
relaxation procedures. Brandt and Livshits suggested wave-ray approach
that allows to overcome such slowness by introducing ray representations
and ray treatment of problematic components. This approach, however, does
not have a straightforward extension for Helmholtz operators with variable
coefficients, since it requires a knowledge of analytical solutions of
homogeneous Helmholtz operator (principal components).
<p>In this talk I will discuss the ways of modifying the wave-ray approach
for solving eigenvalue problems for Helmholtz operators with variable coefficients.
The presented algorithm employs Galerkin based algebraic multigrid, and
modified wave-ray approach, which employs the best current approximation
to the solution instead of principal components. The algorithm and the
results of the numerical experiments will be discussed on the example of
one-dimensional Helmholtz operator with periodic boundary conditions. Joint
work with A.Brandt.
