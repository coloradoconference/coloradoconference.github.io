<p>
Generalized functions occur in many practical applications as source terms
in partial differential applications.
Typical examples are point
sources and sinks in porous media flow that are described by Dirac delta
functions or point loads and dipoles as source terms inducing
electrostatic potentials. We are particularly interested
in bioelectric field computations where the source terms are modeled
by dipoles and where the computational goal is to locate dipole sources
as accurately as possible from electroencephalographic measurements.

For analyzing the accuracy of such computations, standard techniques
cannot be used since they rely on global smoothness. This is both true for
Sobolev space arguments for finite element based methods,
and for continuity and differentiability arguments in finite
difference analysis. At the singularity, the solution tends to infinity and
therefore standard error norms will not even converge.

In this presentation we will demonstrate that these difficulties
can be overcome by using other metrics to measure
accuracy and convergence of the numerical solution.
Only minor modifications
to the discretization and solver are necessary to obtain the same asymptotic
accuracy and efficiency as for regular and smooth solutions.
In particular, no adaptive refinement is necessary and it is also
unnecessary to use techniques which make use of the analytic knowledge of the
singularity. Our method relies simply on a mesh-size
dependent representation of the singular sources
constructed by appropriate smoothing.
It can be proved that the pointwise accuracy is of the same order
as in the regular case. The error coefficient depends on the location
and will deteriorate when approaching the singularity where the error
estimate breaks down. Our approach is therefore useful for accurately
computing the global solution, except in a small neighborhood of the singular
points. In the talk we will demonstrate how these techniques can
be integrated into a multigrid solver exploiting additional techniques for
improving the accuracy, such as Richardson and tau-Extrapolation.

The talk is a follow-up to a paper presented in Copper Mountain in 1987.
