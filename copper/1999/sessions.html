<a name="5"><h2>TUTORIAL DAY AT COPPER MOUNTAIN</h2>

A set of three multigrid tutorials will be presented on Sunday, April 11.
Attendance is open to all, and there is no charge or required registration.
All
three tutorials will be elementary in nature, and are designed to familiarize
the audience with the basics of the topic.

<h3> A Multigrid Tutorial</h3>
9:00 am - 12:00 pm
<br>
Presented by <i>William L. Briggs</i>
</center>
<p>

This presentation is an updated reincarnation of the tutorials Bill gave at
Copper Mountain in 1987 and 1989. The 1987 tutorial led to the publication of
the popular book, <i>A Multigrid Tutorial</i> (SIAM books), which has
served as
the introduction to multigrid for a good many workers in the field.
Assuming no
familiarity with multigrid, the tutorial introduces multigrid from first
principles, examining basic iterative methods, coarse-grid correction,
two-level
approaches, and extending to multigrid methods.
<p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<ul>
<li> Model Problems
<li> Basic Iterative Methods
<li> Elements of Multigrid
<li> Performance
<li> Some Theory
</ul>

<h3> An Algebraic Multigrid Tutorial</h3>
2:00 pm - 4:00 pm
<br>
Presented by <i>Van Emden Henson</i>
</center>
<p>
This introduction focuses <i>primarily</i> on the "classical" AMG of
Brandt, McCormick, and Ruge. An understanding of the principles of
multigrid is assumed, but the tutorial introduces algebraic multigrid
in a simple, practical manner.
<p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>"Classical" AMG</b>
<ul>
<li> <i>Hammers and Wrenches:</i> the Required AMG Toolkit
<li> <i>The Ardent Quest:</i> Seeking Algebraic Smoothness
<li> <i>Get to the Point:</i> Coarse Grid Selection
<li> <i>Building a Better Mousetrap:</i> Prolongation
</ul>
<p>
<li> <b>Other Algebraic Approaches: an Overview</b>
<ul>
<li> Smoothed Aggregation
<li> Multigraph methods
<li> AMGe
<li> Energy-Minimizing Basis methods
</ul>
</ul>

<h3> A Parallel Multigrid Tutorial</h3>
4:30 pm - 5:30 pm
<br>
Presented by <i>Jim E. Jones</i>
</center>
<p>
This presentation focuses on the issues involved in parallelizing a multigrid
algorithm. Assuming no experience with parallel computing, but an
understanding of the principles of multigrid, the tutorial introduces some
of the standard and efficient techniques for developing a parallel
multigrid solver.

<p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<ul>
<li> Algorithmic and implementation scalability.
<li> Parallelization of multigrid by domain partitioning.
<li> Performance models and metrics for parallel multigrid solvers.
<li> Novel parallel multigrid algorithms: multiple coarse grids and concurrent
multigrid.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<a name="6"><h2>FORMAT</h2>
Morning and afternoon sessions will consist of individual
talks of approximately 25 minutes each.   Workshop
and Circus sessions will be held in the evenings.
 
<a name="15"><h2>WORKSHOPS AND CIRCUS SESSIONS</h2>
The program will include special time set aside for
Workshops and Circuses.  The Workshop Chair will encourage and
support informal workshops on special topics of interest.  The
Circus Chair, for each of the three planned circus sessions,
will encourage participation and contributions and will organize,
set the schedule, and oversee its progress.
