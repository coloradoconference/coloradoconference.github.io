Unstructured grids do not have a convenient and natural multigrid framework
for actually computing and maintaining a high floating point rate on standard
computers.  In fact, just the coarsening process is expensive for many
applications.  Since unstrucutured grids play a vital role in many scientific
computing applications, many modifications have been proposed to solve this
problem.  One suggested solution is to map the original unstructured grid onto
a structured grid.  This can be used as a fine grid in a standard multigrid
algorithm to precondition the original problem on the unstructured grid.  We
show that unless extreme care is taken, this mapping can lead to a system with
a high condition number which eliminates the usefulness of the multigrid
method.

Theorems with lower and upper bounds are provided.  Simple examples show that
the upper bounds are sharp.
