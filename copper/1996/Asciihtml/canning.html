Solution of Helmholtz Equation in N Unknowns in Sqrt[N] Operations
</h2>
<pre>
     The scattering of waves by a non penetrable body is considered,
which is the exterior problem for the Helmholtz equation. An integral
equation formulation is used, so unknowns are required only on the
surface of the body. These N unknowns give rise to a matrix equation
involving an N by N matrix, Z. Ordinarily, Z is a full matrix, since a
source on any one part of the body creates a field at all other points
on the body. However, the matrix can be made sparse. Consider the
surface of the body as the union of Sqrt[N] disjoint regions, where
there are Sqrt[N] unknowns on each region. Initially, each unknown
is associated with a source localized near a grid point. Then we
perform a linear transformation acting within each region seperately.
This gives a description in terms of sources which are localized only
within an entire region. The transformation is done so that the
sources radiate highly directional beams. This transformation on the
columns of the matrix is now also done on the rows, so a similarity
transformation results. The resulting matrix will be sparse, in the
sense that nearly all of its elements may be well approximated by
zero. This technique, called the Impedance Matrix Localization (IML)
method, has been described in previous papers. The matrix has O[N]
non zero elements, and there is a method for calculating it in O[N]
operations.

     The sources which are associated with this description of the
problem provide a strong analogy to a model in terms of rays. We
want to solve the matrix problem in a way which maintains this
analogy. This matrix consists of blocks, where each block corresponds
to the interaction of two of the regions described above. Each non
diagonal block has an isolated peak, which is analogous to a
specification of a ray. Each peak consists of O[1] matrix elements,
typically about 50 matrix elements, for either two or three
dimensional problems. We want to find a solution method which
preserves the analogy to a ray description. Thus, we perform a block
factorization to preserve the block structure. To prevent significant
fill in, we make this an approximate factorization using a tolerance
for approximating elements of the factored form by zero. We have
found that even when this tolerance allows several digits of accuracy,
the factored form is nearly as sparse as the matrix before
factorization. Furthermore, we find that many of the operations in
the algorithm give zero contribution, since they involve the product
of some number with zero. When done carefully this calculation can
be done in O[N] operations, as discussed in our previous papers.

     This approximate inverse is a good preconditioner for methods
such as conjugate gradients. However, we find the best results by
using it to define a splitting method. That is, the matrix T is split into
two parts, the inverse of the approximate inverse, and the
remainder. The question that now arises is how fast do we have to be
able to solve the matrix equation for each right hand side so that the
time for the iterative solution does not dominate all other times. All
operations up to the iterative solution can be done in a total time
which is O[N], albeit with a large constant (typically 10,000). For any
scattering problem, for how many right hand sides do we need to
solve it? Each right hand side corresponds to a different angle of
incidence. To resolve all possible interference patterns, we need O[N]
solutions for either two or three dimensional problems, when N is
chosen reasonably (such as for a fixed number of unknowns per
wavelength). However, in practice one never needs this many
solutions. Let us compromise, and say that we need O[Sqrt[N]]
solutions. Then we must be able to find each solution in O[Sqrt[N]]
operations, so that the total time remains O[N].

     Our surprising result is that for sufficiently smooth bodies and for
right hand sides representing radiation incident from a single
direction, it is possible to solve the problem in O[Sqrt[N]] operations
per right hand side. We find that such a right hand side has
O[Sqrt[N]] non zero elements, and so does the solution vector. This is
truly a dramatic improvement over other methods. If this matrix had
been treated as full, even forward and back substitution would have
been O[N*N] operations, while our method is O[Sqrt[N]].

     To see how this is possible, consider first the problem of
calculating the residual at some stage in an iterative solution. This
involves multiplying an N by N matrix by a vector of length N.
Because of sparseness, this matrix has O[1] non zero elements
(typically about 50) per row. What is the operation count for taking
the dot product of one row with the vector? The probability that the
dot product is non zero is O[1/Sqrt[N]], as is the operation count.
When this is done N times, once for each row, the total count is
O[Sqrt[N]].

     In a similar manner, it can be shown that the operation counts for
back substitution and forward substitution are also O[Sqrt[N]]. By
taking the tolerance such that a splitting method gives say one order
of magnitude improvement in residual at each iteration, we find
convergence in O[1] iterations. This produces a method which is
O[Sqrt[N]] per right hand side.
