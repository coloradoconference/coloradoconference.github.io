We report on overlapping Schwarz algorithms 
for nonlinear finite element problems, in particular, for
the full potential equation of aerodynamics. 
The main algorithm, Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS),
uses an inexact finite-difference Newton's method and a Krylov space
iterative method, with an overlapping Schwarz method as a preconditioner.
We show that NKS, combined with a density upwinding continuation strategy,
is robust for problems with weak shocks. Several parameters 
require specification in NKS algorithms in order to obtain good
convergence rates. Practical choices are given for both
numerical convergence rate and execution time 
on some distributed-memory parallel systems.
