In the last few years, domain decomposition methods, previously developed
and tested for standard finite element methods and elliptic problems, have
been extended and modified to work for mortar and other nonconforming finite
element methods. A survey will be given of work carried out jointly with
Yves Achdou, Mario Casarin, Maksymilian Dryja and Yvon Maday. Results on the 
p- and h-p-version finite elements will also be discussed.
