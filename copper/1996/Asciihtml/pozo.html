	A new library design is presented for generic sparse matrix
	C++ objects for use in iterative algorithms and preconditioners.
	This design extends previous work on C++ numerical libraries 
	(SparseLib++[3], IML++[4], Lapack++[5]) by providing a framework 
	in which efficient algorithms can be written *independent* of the 
	matrix layout or format. That is, rather than supporting different 
	codes for each (element type) / (matrix format) combination,  
	only one version of the algorithm need be maintained.  This not only 
	reduces the effort for library developers, but also simplifies the 
	calling interface seen by library users.  Furthermore, the underlying 
	matrix library can be naturally extended to support user-defined 
	objects, such as hierarchical block-structured matrices, or 
	application-specific preconditioners.  Utilizing optimized 
	kernels[1,7] whenever possible, the resulting performance of 
	such framework can be shown to be competitive with optimized Fortran 
	programs.
