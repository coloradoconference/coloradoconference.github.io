Abstract

An algebraically partitioned FETI method for the solution of structural
engineering problems on parallel computers is presented. The present algorithm
consists of three attributes: an explicit  generation of the orthogonal
nullspace matrix associated with the interface  nodal forces, the  floating
subdomain  rigid-body modes computed from the subdomain static equilibrium
equation of the classical force method, and the identification of  redundant
interface force constraint operator that enamates when the interface force
computations are localized.

Numerical valuations indicates that the method is scalable, simple to implement,
and renders relatively high accuracy.   Comparisons of the present method with
the previously developed differentially partitioned FETI-2 method of Farhat,
Roux and Mandel  are offered in terms of the saddle point formulations.
Numerical valuations indicates that the method is scalable, simple to implement,
