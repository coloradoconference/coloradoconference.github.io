<h2>Eigenvalue problems in modeling liquid crystal behavior.
</h2>
<pre>
Equilibrium configurations of liquid crystals in finite
containments are minimizers of the thermodynamic free energy
of the system. It is important to be able to track the equilibrium
configurations as the temperature of the liquid crystals increases.
The path of the minimal energy configuration at bifurcation
points can be computed from the null space of a large sparse symmetric
matrix. We describe a variant of the implicitly restarted Lanczos method
which is well suited for the computation of extreme, as well as interior
eigenvalues of a large sparse symmetric matrix. The method adaptively
determines a polynomial filter by using Leja shifts and requires very
little computer storage. We apply this method to the problem of path
following.
