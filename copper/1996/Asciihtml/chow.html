This workshop talk will compare the results of a variety of block
preconditioning techniques for solving a model supersonic flow
problem.  Block relaxation and block incomplete factorization
preconditioners are coupled with a variety of techniques for exact and
approximate block solves and inversion.  The talk will begin with a
basic introduction to transonic and supersonic airfoil calculations.
We will also demonstrate experimentally how block `perturbed' (also
known as `stabilized' or `shifted') factorizations can be effective
when applied `non-rigorously' to general sparse matrices.  The model
problem will be a 2-D supersonic flow over a wedge in a channel.  The
Euler equations governing the flow in two dimensions are discretized
with the finite volume method, using modified Steger-Warming flux
vector splitting.  If possible, we will also demonstrate the results on
problems gathered from industrial CFD codes.
