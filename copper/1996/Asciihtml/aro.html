The numerical simulation of chemically reacting flows is a subject 
that has attracted a great deal of current research. Applications        
such as combustion, groundwater flow, climate modeling, and atmospheric
modeling rely heavily on numerical techniques for reactive flows, and
can stretch current supercomputing capabilities to the limit.

The solution of the ODEs modeling the chemistry in these problems is
often the most time consuming part of the simulation, and much of the
research over the past eighteen months has addressed the need to
solve these types of equations accurately and efficiently. One methodology
that has shown considerable promise is the preconditioned time 
differencing paradigm. Here, an implicit ODE time stepping method is
combined with an iterative technique for solving simultaneous nonlinear
algebraic systems. Applied to chemical kinetics problems, these techniques
result in explicit time stepping methods with unconditional (or nearly
unconditional) numerical stability.

We present a theoretical analysis establishing sufficient conditions
for the stability and convergence of these time stepping methods.
We will also demonstrate their usefulness in applications by comparison
with the more common implicit BDF formulas. Examples will be drawn from
the atmospheric and combustion sciences.
