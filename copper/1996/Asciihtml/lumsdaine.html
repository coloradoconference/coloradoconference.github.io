Waveform relaxation is an iterative technique for the parallel
solution of time-dependent problems.  Traditional waveform iterative
techniques, which are analagous to the Jacobi or Seidel iterations
from linear algebra, can exhibit prohibitively slow convergence rates
for many problems.  Thus, methods to accelerate the convergence rate
of waveform relaxation are sought.

In this paper, we study Krylov subspace techniques for accelerating
the convergence of waveform relaxation for solving linear
time-invariant initial value problems.  For solving systems of linear
equations, Krylov-subspace methods such as CG or GMRES converge
substantially better than simple iterative methods such as Richardson
or Gauss-Jacobi.  Unfortunately, because of the spectral (and
pseudospectral) properties of the waveform relaxation operator, a
similar improvement in convergence rate is not as easily obtained when
applying Krylov-subspace acceleration techniques to waveform
relaxation.  We show that in order to obtain the optimal rate of
convergence, i.e., the rate of convergence obtained by an optimal
accelaration method applied to the matrix problem corresponding to the
initial-value problem, one must combine iterates using convolution
techniques.  Based on this observation, we present and analyze a new
class of accelerated waveform methods, convolution Krylov subspace
methods.
