Newton-Krylov methods and Krylov-Schwarz methods
have begun to become established in computational fluid dynamics
over the past decade.  The former employ a Krylov method
inside of Newton's method in a
Jacobian-free manner, through directional differencing.
The latter employ an overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition
to derive a preconditioner for the Krylov accelerator that relies
primarily on local information, for data-parallel concurrency.
They may be composed
as Newton-Krylov-Schwarz methods, which seem particularly
well suited for solving nonlinear elliptic systems in high-latency,
distributed-memory environments.
We give a brief description of this family of algorithms, with an emphasis
on domain decomposition iterative aspects.  We then
describe numerical simulations with Newton-Krylov-Schwarz
methods on a family of unstructured-grid Euler problems, emphasizing
comparisons with a standard defect-correction approach,  subdomain
preconditioner consistency, subdomain preconditioner quality,
and the effect of a coarse grid.
