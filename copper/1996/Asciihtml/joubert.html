This talk will focus on practical experiences with iterative
linear solver algorithms used in conjunction with Amoco Production
Company's Falcon oil reservoir simulation code.  The goal of
this study is to determine the best linear solver algorithms for these
types of problems.  The results of numerical experiments will be presented.
