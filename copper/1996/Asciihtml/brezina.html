We propose an abstract two-level algorithm with convergence
independent of the coarse-space size.
The abstract algorithm is applied to problems of solids discretized
on unstructured meshes.
With no regularity assumptions we prove uniform convergence with respect to
coarse-space size, domain, essential boundary conditions and jumps in
Young modulus. Jumps are not assumed to be aligned with subdomainns.
Numerical experiments confirm the theory and show that the method works well
even if some assumptions of the theory are violated.
