GMRES(k) is widely used for solving nonsymmetric linear systems.
However, it is inadequate either when it converges only for $k$ close
to the problem size or when numerical error in the modified
Gram-Schmidt process used in the GMRES orthogonalization phase
dramatically affects the algorithm performance.  An adaptive version of
GMRES(k) which tunes the restart value $k$ based on criteria estimating
the GMRES convergence rate for the given problem is proposed here.
This adaptive GMRES(k) procedure outperforms standard GMRES(k), several
other GMRES-like methods, and QMR on actual large scale sparse
structural mechanics postbuckling and analog circuit simulation
problems.  There are some applications, such as homotopy methods for
high Reynolds number viscous flows, solid mechanics postbuckling
analysis, and analog circuit simulation, where very high accuracy in
the linear system solutions is essential. In this context, the modified
Gram-Schmidt process in GMRES can fail causing the entire GMRES
iteration to fail.  It is shown that the adaptive GMRES(k) with the
orthogonalization performed by Householder transformations succeeds
whenever GMRES(k) with the orthogonalization performed by the modified
Gram-Schmidt process fails, and the extra cost of computing Householder
transformations is justified for these applications.
