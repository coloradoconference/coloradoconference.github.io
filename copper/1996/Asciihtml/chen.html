The numerical solution of boundary integral equations gives rise to
dense linear systems that often have unsymmetric matrices. As all
boundary integral equations posses some kind of singularity, iterative
methods (two-grid and multi-grid type, CG-type) generally do require
preconditioning for any convergence. Only in the case of weak 
singularities, has preconditioning been found non-essential.

Recently various practical preconditioning techniques have been proposed
for the difficult case of strong singularities that include [1-4] among
others. Such preconditioners or their inverses are sparse. They were
mostly proposed based on efficiency considerations and heuristic arguments
and have not been fully justified in theory.

Here we present two new contributions towards understanding and designing
such sparse preconditioners. 

Firstly we have generalized the work of [5] on singular integral equations
to singular boundary integral equations and have shown that
operator splitting offers a new way of regularizations into compact
operators. Essentially, by studying the discretization process, we can
identify part of an integral operator representing all singularities and
follow its corresponding discretization leading to part of the full matrix,
that is usually sparse. Then such a sparse matrix is used to construct a
suitable preconditioner. With this approach, we can see the close link between
matrix splitting and integral operator splitting. More importantly the
preconditioned matrix like the preconditioned integral operator can be
shown to have its eigenvalues clustered at a fixed point.

Secondly we have investigated the possibility of constructing an approximate
inverse preconditioner [2,4,6] that may involve the solution of a least
squares problem. We show that the method of [1], while approximately
solving such a least squares problem, possesses the nice property of
singularity separation and leads to a robust preconditioner that clusters
eigenvalues.

Numerical experiments that support the theoretical results are reported.
For comparison purpose, we also report results on using the fast wavelet
transform (FWT) as a preconditioner. Our conclusion is that singularity
separation based preconditioners perform better than approximate inverse 
based while it is desirable to have both features.
