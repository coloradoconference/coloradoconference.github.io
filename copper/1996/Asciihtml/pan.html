  We specify some initial assumptions that guarantee rapid refinement of a
rough initial approximation to the inverse of a Cauchy-like matrix, by mean
of our new modification of Newton's iteration, where the input, output, and
all the auxiliary matrices are represented with their short generators defined
by the associated scaling operators. The computations are performed fast since
they are confined to operations with short generators of the given and
computed matrices. Because of the known correlations among various structured
matrices, the algorithm is immediately extended to rapid refinement of rough
initial approximations to the inverses of Vandermonde--like,
Chebyshev--Vandermonde--like and Toeplitz--like matrices, where again,
the computations are confined to operations with short generators of the
involved matrices.
