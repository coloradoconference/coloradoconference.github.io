We have recently developed a class of finite difference methods which
provide higher accuracy and greater stability than standard central or
upwind difference methods, but still reside on a compact patch of grid
cells.   In the present study we investigate the performance of several
gradient-type iterative methods for solving the associated sparse systems. 
Both serial and parallel performance studies have been made. 
Representative examples are taken from elliptic PDE's for diffusion,
convection-diffusion, and viscous flow applications.
