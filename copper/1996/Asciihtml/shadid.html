ABSTRACT

In this talk we present some preliminary performance results
for the fully coupled iterative solution of reacting flow simulations
using Newton - Krylov methods. The nonlinear solution technique
is based on an implementation of an inexact Newton method with
backtracking. This nonlinear solution algorithm adaptively selects
the convergence criteria for the underlying linear solvers based on
how well the linearized problem is approximating the nonlinear equations.
This procedure decreases the required solution time by reducing the
amount of oversolving of the linear systems. The robust parallel solutions
of the linear systems is obtained with preconditioned Krylov subspace
techniques. The Krylov methods include GMRES, TFQMR, BiCGSTAB, CGS.
The preconditioners are based on block diagonal scaling and domain
decomposition preconditioners including incomplete point and block
factorizations along with direct sparse factorizations. Results
are presented for example benchmark CFD problems and reacting flow
simulations of gallium arsenide deposition in metal organic
chemical vapor deposition reactors on a 1840 processor Intel
Paragon.
