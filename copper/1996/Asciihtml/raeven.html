Arnoldi's method is one of the iterative methods for standard and
generalised eigenvalue problems, for the computation of exterior
eigenvalues. With `shift-and-invert' techniques the method can also
be used for interior eigenvalues.

For polynomial eigenproblems, e.g. Ax+lambda Bx + lambda^2 Cx=0, a
well-known approach is to rewrite the problem into a much larger generalised
eigenproblem. The method of Arnoldi can be applied to this linearised form.
This approach has the obvious disadvantage that the size of the problem is
considerably increased: the dimension is multiplied by the degree of the
polynomial, so that quadratic problems become twice as large, fifth order
problems become five times as large, etcetera.

We will present a generalisation the Arnoldi iteration that can be applied to
polynomial problems in their original form. This new method is more efficient
than the Arnoldi method on the expanded linearised form, both in storage and in
computation. Incorporation of accelaration techniques like `shift-and-invert'
tirns out to be simple.
