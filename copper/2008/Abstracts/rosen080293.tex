A recent theoretical result on optimized Schwarz algorithm presented
in [SISC, 29(6),pp 2402--2425] enables the modification of an existing
Schwarz procedure to its optimized counterpart. In this work, it is
shown how to modify a bilinear FEM based Schwarz preconditioning strategy
to its optimized version. The latter is then employed to precondition the
pseudo Laplacian operator arising from the spectral element discretization
of the magnetohydrodynamic equations.
