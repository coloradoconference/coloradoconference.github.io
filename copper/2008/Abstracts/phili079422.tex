Preliminary results are presented for the solution of non-equilibrium
radiation diffusion problems on dynamic, adaptively refined grids.
Implicit time integration is used to step over the smallest time-scales
in the problem and instead follow the dynamic time scales of interest.
BDF2 and Backward Euler time integration schemes are considered. At each
time step it is necessary to solve a nonlinear coupled system of
equations for radiation energy and material temperature. A preconditioned
inexact Newton-Krylov method is used for the nonlinear solves. The
physics based preconditioner for the Krylov solver internally uses
multilevel solvers based on the Fast Adaptive Composite(FAC) grid method
and its variants.

This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of
Energy by Los Alamos National Laboratory under contract W-7405-ENG-36.
