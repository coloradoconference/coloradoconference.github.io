Filter methods have been introduced as an alternative to penalty
functions as a globalization strategy for nonlinear optimization methods.
A filter borrows ideas from multi-objective optimization and accepts a
trial point whenever the objective or the constraint violation is
improved compared to previous iterates.

We present a non-monotone filter method that offers greater freedom at
accepting points. The methods are implemented in FASTr, our filter
active-set trust-region framework. We present recent numerical experience
comparing various globalization strategies, as well as different
step-computation techniques.
