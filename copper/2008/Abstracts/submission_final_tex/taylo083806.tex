We have implemented a fully implicit time integration scheme into a
version of Los Alamos National Laboratories' popular ocean general
circulation model POP (Parallel Ocean Program). POP has traditionally
used a semi-implicit time integration scheme where key linear terms in
the equations are treated implicitly and the remaining terms are treated
explicitly. In our fully implicit scheme, we use Crank-Nicholson on all
terms of the equations and Jacobian free Newton-Krylov iterations to
solve the resulting system. We substantially reduce the number of
iterations needed by POP's semi-implicit integration scheme as a
preconditioner. In idealized geometries, we can achieve timesteps 800
times larger than allowed by the semi-implicit scheme. For simulations of
the North Atlantic and the global ocean, we can obtain time steps up to
25 times larger than allowed by the semi-implicit scheme. These realistic
simulations use actual topography, continental geometry, initial Levitus
temperature and salinity, observed annual averaged wind stress and
restoring boundary conditions at the surface for temperature and
salinity.
