Solving inverse problems using sparsity as a regularization
is a new and promising frontier.
So far a fixed, single level approach is taken for
the solution of the problem.

In this work we present a multilevel approach for the
solution of the problem. We generate a multilevel dictionary
which adopts to the images at different levels.
