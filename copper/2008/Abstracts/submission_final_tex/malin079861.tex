Many existing computational methods for solving the incompressible
Navier--Stokes equations depend on the availability of strategies for
approximating the associated pressure equation
which is a consequence of the incompressibility constraint.
Examples of methods that require such approximations are
segregated solution strategies where velocity and pressure updates
are obtained separately, and preconditioned Krylov subspace methods with
preconditioners derived from the Schur complement reduction.
Recently, consistent ways to approximate the pressure have emerged.
We consider the derivation of such splitting schemes and show how these
ideas can be utilized to develop block preconditioners that have solid
foundations on the underlying partial differential equation model of
fluid flow.
