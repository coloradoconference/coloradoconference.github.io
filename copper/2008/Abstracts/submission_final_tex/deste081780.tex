A smoothed aggregation multigrid method is presented for the numerical
calculation of the stationary probability
vector of irreducible Markov chains. It is shown how smoothing the
interpolation and restriction operators can dramatically increase the
efficiency of aggregation multigrid methods for Markov chains that have
been proposed in the literature.
The proposed smoothing approach is inspired by smoothed aggregation
multigrid for linear systems, supplemented with a new lumping technique
that assures well-posedness of the coarse-level problems: the
coarse-level operators are singular M-matrices on all levels, resulting
in strictly positive coarse-level corrections on all levels. Numerical
results show how these methods lead to nearly-optimal multigrid
efficiency for a representative set of test problems, both when geometric
and algebraic aggregation strategies are used.
