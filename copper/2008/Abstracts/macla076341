===ABSTRACT:
For many systems of partial differential equations, multigrid methods
are known to be amongst the most efficient numerical techniques for
solving the resulting matrix systems.  This efficiency results from
achieving appropriate complementarity in the smoothing and coarse-grid
correction processes; in practice, achieving this complementarity is
often the most difficult (and always the most important) question
in designing the multigrid process.  In this talk, we discuss recent
work in developing a general framework for the local Fourier analysis
(LFA) of multigrid methods for arbitrary systems of PDEs.  A
particular motivation for revisiting this subject was to unify the
treatment of staggered discretizations within LFA.  Furthermore, a
general technique for the LFA of overlapping multiplicative smoothers is
presented.  The resulting tools are demonstrated for a variety of
systems of PDEs, including the Stokes, curl-curl, and grad-div
systems.
