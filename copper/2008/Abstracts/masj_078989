===ABSTRACT:
In~\cite{bcmm:03} a factorized approximate inverse preconditioner
 (AISM) based on the Sherman-Morrison formula is presented. In this work
 the structure of the factors is analyzed and it is proved that the $L$ and
 $D$ factors of the $LDU$ factorization of a matrix are easily retrieved from
 one of them.
 Moreover columns of $L$ and $L^{-1}$ are computed in the same step which makes
 the application of dropping strategies proposed in~\cite{bs:02} straightforward
 in the case of a symmetric positive definite coefficient matrix.

 Numerical experiments on a set of symmetric positive definite matrices are done
 showing that this strategy, that we called Balanced Incomplete Factorization
 (BIF for short), is very robust for preconditioning very ill--conditioned
 problems using iterative methods.
 In addition BIF exhibits shorter setup times than RIF \cite{betu:03},
a method
of a similar and very high level of robustness.
