===ABSTRACT:
Applying smoothed aggregation multigrid (SA) to solve nonsymmetric linear systems, $A {\bf x} = {\bf b}$, can be problematic due to a lack of minimization principle in the coarse-grid corrections.   We propose an approach that is based on applying SA to the symmetric positive definite matrices $\sqrt{A^* A}$ or $\sqrt{A A^*}$.  These matrices however, are typically full and difficult to compute, and it is therefore not computationally efficient to use them directly to form a coarse-grid correction.   Our proposed approach approximates these coarse-grid corrections by using smoothed aggregation to accurately approximate singular vectors of $A$ that correspond to the lowest singular value.  We present some preliminary theory two-level convergence theory for unsmoothed versions the intergrid transfer operators and simple examples to illustrate this theory.
