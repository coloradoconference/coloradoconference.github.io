===ABSTRACT:
In this talk, we analyze the use of inexact solves in a Krylov-based
model reduction setting and present the resulting structured perturbation
effects on the underlying model reduction problem.  We first illustrate that for a selection of interpolation points that satisfy first-order necessary $H_{2}$-optimality
conditions, a primitive basis remains remarkably well-conditioned and
errors due to inexact solves do not tend to degrade the reduced order
models. 

We show that when inexact solves are performed within a Petrov-Galerkin framework, the resulting reduced order models are backward stable with respect to the
approximating transfer function.  As a consequence, Krylov-based model
reduction with well chosen interpolation points is robust with respect to
the structured perturbations due to inexact solves.  General bounds on the
$H_{2}$ system error associated with an inexact reduced order model are
introduced that provide a new tool to understand the structured backward
error and stopping criteria.
