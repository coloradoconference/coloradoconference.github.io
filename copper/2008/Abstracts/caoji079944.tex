Popular approaches for solving the shallow water equations
for climate modeling are explicit and semi-implicit methods.
In this talk, we discuss a fully implicit method for solving the shallow
water equations on the cubed sphere. In the fully
implicit method, a large sparse nonlinear system of equations
needs to be solved at each time step, and the focus of the talk is a
parallel, fully coupled, Newton-Krylov-Schwarz algorithm
with a Jacobian matrix approximately calculated on a weakly
non-matching mesh on the cubed sphere. We show numerically
that with such a preconditioned nonlinearly implicit method the
time step size is no longer constrained by the CFL number and
the parallel scalability of the algorithm on machines with
a large number of processors will be reported.
