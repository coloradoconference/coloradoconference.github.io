===ABSTRACT:
Optimal Mass Transport is an important problem that appears in wide range of disciplines. Its applicability has been demonstrated in image processing tasks such as registration and morphing where it has been shown that the mass transport model fits a variety of images such as fluid flow, flame propagation, clouds and more. 

Recently, a mathematical framework was proposed to solve this problem. Within this framework, the problem is 
converted to a time dependent  PDE with  a trajectory  that converges to the
solution of the optimization problem.
In the current work we explore a numerically efficient method for the  solution of the reformulated problem. We show that by combining a consistent
discretization, an appropriate conservative iteration and
multilevel/multigrid methods for the solution of the problem we can
dramatically reduce the computational cost associated with its solution.
This makes the use of this approach on 3D grids and other large bodies of data feasible and furthers the applicability of OMT for image processing
tasks.
