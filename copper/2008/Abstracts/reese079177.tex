A non-Darcy partial differential equation (PDE) model for single-phase
flow through porous media is presented. The model is not only nonlinear
in the non-Darcy term, but also in the advection term which appears in
the momentum conservation law. The focus of this talk is on the numerical
implementation of the model using the Sandia National Laboratories PDE
simulation framework, Sundance. In particular, the discussion will
include the finite element discretization and the effect of the
heterogeneity of the media.
