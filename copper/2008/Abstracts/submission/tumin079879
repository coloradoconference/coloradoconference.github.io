===ABSTRACT:
Pressure convection-diffusion preconditioners are based on an approximation to the 
inverse Schur complement where the true Schur complement is obtained by eliminating 
velocity variables from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This
inverse Schur complement is essentially approximated by the product of two 
matrices: a convection-diffusion operator and an approximation to the inverse 
Laplacian. These operators follow from commuting properties of certain 
differential operators away from boundaries.  While these operators are now fairly 
well understood for the domain interior, appropriate boundary conditions for
defining the preconditioning operators are significantly less clear. 

In this talk, we look closely at boundary conditions.  We show in particular that 
for problems with velocities satisfying inflow boundary conditions, the 
preconditioner can be defined so that discrete commutativity holds exactly at 
the inflow boundary.  That is, in certain situations the inverse Schur complement 
approximation is exact, even at domain boundaries.  This exact relationship 
motivates new boundary conditions which give rise to good preconditioners in more 
general settings. In addition to examining standard pressure convection-diffusion 
preconditioners, the analysis motivates a simple and practical modification to the 
related least squares commutator method (LSC).  We demonstrate that the new boundary
conditions have a significant impact on the convergence behavior of both the 
pressure convection-diffusion method and the LSC method. Further, mesh independent
convergence rates are now obtained for both methods in cases where previously some 
convergence deterioration occurred as the mesh was refined.
