===ABSTRACT:
We are solving inverse problems in groundwater modeling.  Given values
of hydraulic head at discrete locations, we seek to approximate values 
of hydraulic conductivity for the entire field.  We are using ADH, a
finite element code developed at the Coastal & Hydraulics Lab in
Vicksburg, MS.  When using ADH to model large, complex groundwater
behavior -- for instance the entire state of Florida -- extreme 
run-times prohibit the frequent function calls needed for parameter
estimation.  Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a method to
reduce the size of the problem to calibrate ADH, reducing the number
of full function calls needed.  We will introduce the problem, discuss 
POD and how it is used for steady-state problems, and demonstrate
the accuracy of the POD solution compared to the full ADH solution.
