===ABSTRACT:

To optimize the optical properties of 
thin film solar cells it is necessary to simulate the optical properties of the nanostructure of these solar cells.
The finite difference time domain method for Maxwell¥s equations
is a suitable method for such simulations.
To reduce the computational amount fast iterative solvers are needed.
