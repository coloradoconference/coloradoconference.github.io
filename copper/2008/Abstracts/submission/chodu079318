===ABSTRACT:
We propose and analyze a uniform preconditioner for the linear
elasticity problem for a homogeneous isotropic compressible elastic materials.  The construction of the preconditioner is based on a subspace correction method employed in solving the
generalized finite element method (GFEM) discretization of a scalar PDE on unstructured simplicial meshes.
