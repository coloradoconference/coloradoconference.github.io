Image registration is a highly ill posed problem.
We present a mathematically sound formulation that explicitly
controls the deformation in terms of the determinant of the Jacobian of
the transformation.
This approach guaranties
grid regularity and prevent folding.

To solve the large-scale inequality constrained optimization problem, we
present a numerical approach based on a multilevel
primal dual SQP method. We demonstrate
its efficiency on a few model problems.
