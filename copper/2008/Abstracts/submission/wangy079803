===ABSTRACT:
We develop a sixth order finite difference discretization strategy
to solve the two dimensional Poisson equation, which is based on the multigrid
method, Richardson extrapolation and an operator interpolation scheme. Our modified
multigrid algorithm, which is similar to the full multigrid method (FMG), can
yield the fourth order approximate solution on both the fine grid and the coarse grid. Then we apply the Richardson extrapolation to compute a sixth order accurate coarse grid solution. The sixth order accurate fine grid solution can  be computed by using
an operator interpolation scheme. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the
accuracy and efficiency of our new method, compared to the sixth order Richardson
extrapolation compact (REC) discretization strategy using Alternating Direction
Implicit (ADI) method and the standard fourth order compact difference (FOC)
scheme using multigrid method.
