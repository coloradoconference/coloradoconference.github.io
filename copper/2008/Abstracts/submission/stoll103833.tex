The Bramble-Pasciak Conjugate Gradient algorithm is a widely used tool in
the finite element community. Motivated by a reformulation of the linear
system in saddle point form, we introduce Bramble-Pasciak-like methods
that can be used to solve problems coming from optimization. We
illustrate that the eigenvalues for the preconditioned matrix in this
setup have a very similar (sometimes equivalent) structure to the
preconditioned matrix of a method which uses a constraint preconditioner.
We furthermore give numerical results for optimization examples.
