Applying smoothed aggregation multigrid (SA) to solve nonsymmetric linear
systems, $A {\bf x} = {\bf b}$, can be problematic due to a lack of
minimization principle in the coarse-grid corrections. We propose an
approach that is based on applying SA to the symmetric positive definite
matrices $\sqrt{A^* A}$ or $\sqrt{A A^*}$. These matrices however, are
typically full and difficult to compute, and it is therefore not
computationally efficient to use them directly to form a coarse-grid
correction. Our proposed approach approximates these coarse-grid
corrections by using smoothed aggregation to accurately approximate
singular vectors of $A$ that correspond to the lowest singular value. We
present some preliminary theory two-level convergence theory for
unsmoothed versions the intergrid transfer operators and simple examples
to illustrate this theory.
