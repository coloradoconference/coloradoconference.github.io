===ABSTRACT:
The exponential growth of communication costs relative to computation on modern computers motivates revisiting a previously dismissed set of algorithms: $s$-step Krylov subspace methods.  One iteration of an $s$-step method has almost the same communication cost as one iteration of its related standard Krylov method, but accomplishes the same work as $s$ of these iterations.  We address concerns which hindered the earlier acceptance of these algorithms: performance, numerical stability, and preconditioning.
