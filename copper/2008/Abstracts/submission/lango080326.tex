We combine two ideas. First some new 'tall-skinny' algorithms have been
rediscovered, they enable to orthogonalize a block of vectors very
efficiently. Those algorithms are latency-tolerant. We consider the MGS
variant of those algorithms. Second, we apply the same blocking as for
Householder reflection for MGS, this idea is presented in Bjorck, 1997.
These two ideas combined together give an efficient orthogonalization
scheme for eigensolvers and block iterative methods. We note that
blocking in MGS is worthwhile to be considered in the case of GMRES.
