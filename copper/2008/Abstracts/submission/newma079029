===ABSTRACT:
This presentation examines the performance of selected parallel, "physics-based" preconditioning methods applied
to the Laplace--Beltrami Target Metric (LBTM) mesh smoothing equations. These equations constitute a nonlinear elliptic 
system of partial differential equations and are primarly used for unstructured mesh
generation on complex geometry. When a target metric mesh improvement method is used, the three coordinate
equations are coupled through the metric. The weak form of this system
is solved using a standard Jacobian-free Newton--Krylov approach, employing the NOX, EPETRA 
and AZTECOO packages
contained in Sandia National Laboratories TRILINOS project.  

Historically the use of Laplace--Beltrami mesh generation methods have been 
limited by the scalability and efficiency of linear solvers.
This work focuses on a study
of the effectiveness and parallel scalability of selected "physics-based" preconditioners applied to this
problem, and presents numerical examples to support this study
and to provide for comparison of the preconditioning strategies.
