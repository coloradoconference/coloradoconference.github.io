In image processing, image registration is one of the fundamental tasks
to compare or combine the information given by different images. Image
registration is to find an optimal geometric transformation between
corresponding image data. We use the deformation method to find this
optimal transformation and then apply the Lagrange multiplier rule in
minimization of the difference between two given images. Here, the
least-squares finite element method was used for the solution of the
optimality system.
