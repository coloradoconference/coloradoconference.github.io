===ABSTRACT:
We demonstrate the performance of a fast computational algorithm
for modeling the design of a microfluidic mixing device. The mixing 
device uses an electrokinetic process, induced charge 
electroosmosis, by which a flow through the device is driven by a
set of charged obstacles in it. The device's design is realized by 
manipulating the shape and orientation of the obstacles in order to 
maximize the amount of fluid mixing within the device. The 
computations required in the modeling of the electrokinetic process 
entails the solution of a constrained optimization problem in which 
function evaluations require the numerical solution of a set of 
partial differential equations: a potential equation, the 
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and a mass transport 
equation.  The most expensive component of the function evaluation 
(which must be performed at every step of an iteration for the 
optimization) is the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.  We
show that by using some new robust algorithms for this task, based 
on certain preconditioners that take advantage of the structure of 
the linearized problem and approximate the Schur complement, this
computation can be done efficiently.  Using this computational
strategy, in conjunction with a derivative-free pattern search
algorithm for the optimization, applied to a finite element
discretization of the problem, we are able to determine optimal
configurations of microfluidic devices.
