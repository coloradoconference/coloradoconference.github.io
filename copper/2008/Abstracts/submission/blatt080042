===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we present generic matrix and vector data structures
supporting a recursive block structure. Using these it is easy to
resemble structural information of PDE systems in different ways
(e.g. variable-to-unknown mappings, variable-to-point mappings). 

We will show that this allows for natural and efficient generic implementation of aggregation based algebraic multigrid methods for PDE systems.
