We wish to obtain accurate structural and thermodynamic properties
of both atomic and molecular fluids. Current equations used to
describe such quantities have significant shortcomings. In "Optimized
theory for simple and molecular fluids" (J. Chem. Phys. 126, 124107,
2007), Marucho and Pettitt propose an improvement upon
the existing theory. We present a computational approach to solving this
new theory and enable simulations of fluid properties changing as a
function of fluid densities. This analysis can be accomplished through a
continuation study. We present continuation results using the software
package LOCA in Trilinos, a Sandia
National Labs solver framework.
