===ABSTRACT:
Different PDEs, different discretizations, different adaptive techniques...
In this talk, efforts are directed towards a general and efficient linearly 
semi-implicit time-stepping technique adaptable to a large class of 
problems. Using Rosenbrock-W methods and ideas from Jacobian free 
approaches for nonlinear equations an efficient time-stepping procedure 
is constructed. Simple approaches for preconditioning the resulting linear 
system are discussed and an application to a high-order discontinuous 
Galerkin nonhydrostatic mesoscale model is presented.
