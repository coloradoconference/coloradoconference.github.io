===ABSTRACT:
We propose and analyze a pseudo-transient continuation algorithm for
dynamics on subsets of $R^N$. Examples include certain
flows on manifolds and the dynamic formulation of bound-constrained
optimization problems. The method gets its global convergence properties
from the dynamics and inherits its local convergence properties from
any fast locally convergent iteration.
