Microarray data analysis (MDA) has become an important tool in molecular
biology. Modern microarray data provide vast amounts of useful biological
information, but their analysis is computationally challenging. Molecular
biologists need fast, reliable, and advanced MDA software, e.g., to
locate clusters
of genes responsible for specific biological processes. Novel
mathematical algorithms for MDA, including the recently available
GeneChip tiling arrays, are necessary to widen the bottlenecks of
existing software, which primarily are slow performance and low accuracy.

Our core expertise is in development of iterative methods and software
for numerical solution of eigenvalue problems [1-4]. In this work, we
develop eigenvalue solvers tailored for MDA, specifically for spectral
gene clustering and bi-clustering. Our particular case study is finding
functional gene clusters
responsive to the novel regulation of growth and development of an
organism through the fatty acid signaling using Affimetrix microarray
chip technology data from [5] in collaboration with Marina Kniazeva of
Howard Hughes Medical Institute and University of Colorado at Boulder.
