In this talk a dual-mixed finite element approximation of a nonlinear
system of PDEs modeling a generalized Stokes flow is described. Through
the introduction of auxiliary unknowns with relevant physical meaning,
the method reduces the regularity requirements for the approximation
spaces and yields an approach that is well-suited for adaptive
computation. The method is analyzed in Sobolev spaces which arise
naturally in the problem formulation, and it is shown that lowest-order
Raviart-Thomas elements and piecewise constant functions are suitable for
approximation. A posteriori error estimates, defined by a nonlinear
projection of the residues of the variational problem, are also
discussed.
