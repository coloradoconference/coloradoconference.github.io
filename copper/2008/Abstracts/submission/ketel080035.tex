Popular discretizations of disordered physical systems produce large
matrices which are extremely ill conditioned, challenging even the most
sophisticated iterative methods. For highly disordered background fields,
the algebraically smooth error modes are not geometrically smooth in any
sense, making the usual multilevel methods inadequate. We present a
discretization of a simplified model problem based on a least-squares
approach that eliminates some difficulties found in previous
discretizations. We describe a solution technique for the resulting
linear system based on smoothed aggregation multigrid and give numerical
results. Extensions to higher-dimensional disordered physical systems are
discussed.
