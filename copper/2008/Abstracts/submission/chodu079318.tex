We propose and analyze a uniform preconditioner for the linear
elasticity problem for a homogeneous isotropic compressible elastic
materials. The construction of the preconditioner is based on a subspace
correction method employed in solving the
generalized finite element method (GFEM) discretization of a scalar PDE
on unstructured simplicial meshes.
