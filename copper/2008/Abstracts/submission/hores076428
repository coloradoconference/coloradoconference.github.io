===ABSTRACT:
The field of optimal experimental design of over-determined
problems is well established, covering a diverse of optimality criteria.
Yet, despite the practical necessity, optimal experimental design of
ill-posed problems and in particular non-linear problems has hardly been
addressed. In this talk we discuss the intrinsic differences between
over-determined and ill-posed experimental design, the complications arising
due to non-linearity, and finally we propose a generic framework for optimal
experimental design of non-linear ill-posed problems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm for several common model problems.
