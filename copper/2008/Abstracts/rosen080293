===ABSTRACT:
A recent theoretical result on optimized Schwarz algorithm presented
in [SISC, 29(6),pp 2402--2425] enables the modification of an existing 
Schwarz procedure to its optimized counterpart. In this work, it is 
shown how to modify a bilinear FEM based Schwarz preconditioning strategy 
to its optimized version. The latter is then employed to precondition the 
pseudo Laplacian operator arising from the spectral element discretization 
of the magnetohydrodynamic equations.
