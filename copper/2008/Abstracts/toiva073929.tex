A nonoverlapping domain decomposition method is described for Helmholtz
problems discretized by a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method.
The discretization uses plane wave basis functions and Lagrange
multipliers to enforce a weak continuity of solution over element
interfaces. A system of linear equations is formulated for the Lagrange
multipliers on the subdomain interfaces. This poorly conditioned system
is solved iteratively with a local preconditioner after it has been
projected onto the complement of a coarse space in the same way as in the
FETI-H method. Numerical experiments study the iterative solution of
two-dimensional and three-dimensional model problems and compare the
convergence and accuracy to the FETI-DPH method.
