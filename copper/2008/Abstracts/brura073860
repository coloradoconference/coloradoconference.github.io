===ABSTRACT:
In this paper preconditioners for the Conjugate Gradient are studied to solve the Newton system with symmetric positive definite Jacobian. In particular, we define a sequence of preconditioners built by means of BFGS rank-two updates. Optimality conditions are derived which guarantee that the preconditioned matrices are not far from the identity in a matrix norm. Some notes on the implementation of the 
corresponding inexact Newton method are given and some numerical results on a model problem illustrate the application of the proposed preconditioners.
