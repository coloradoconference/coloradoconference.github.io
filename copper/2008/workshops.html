  Trilinos Workshop<br/>
  Monday, April 7, 2008<br/>
  7:30 pm<br/>
</h1><br/>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
The Trilinos project at Sandia National Laboratories is an ongoing effort 
to develop
high-quality, modern parallel numerical software libraries for the solution of
large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific applications
(http://trilinos.sandia.gov).
In this workshop we provide an overview of Trilinos and its unique package
architecture, and highlight some available and upcoming capabilities.
Following an overview presentation, package developers will discuss in greater
detail the following Trilinos
libraries: Sundance (a natural-language parallel finite-element solver),
Stratimikos (a unified solution linear solver/preconditioning interface),
Belos (block iterative linear solvers), Meros (segregated preconditioning),
and ML (algebraic multigrid preconditioning).


<h2>Individual talks</h2>

<h3>"Building parallel multi-physics simulations with Sundance"</h3>

Kevin Long<br/>
Department of Mathematics and Statistics<br/>

<p>
<u>Abstract</u><br/>
Sundance is a Trilinos package containing components for building parallel PDE
simulations. This talk will give an overview of Sundance with examples of
setting up complex multiphysics simulations and accessing Trilinos solvers.

"Stratimikos: Unified Access to Trilinos Linear Solver and
Preconditioner Capabilities"
</h3>

Roscoe A. Bartlett<br/>
Department of Optimization and Uncertainty Estimation<br/>
Sandia National Laboratories 

<p>
<u>Abstract</u><br/>
The Trilinos Stratimikos package provides an aggregated,
parameter-list-driver, "Facade" class for access to many of the
linear solver and preconditioner capabilities such as in the Trilinos packages
Amesos, AztecOO, Belos, Ifpack, and ML. All you need is an Epetra_Operator
and/or (even better) an Epetra_RowMatrix object for the defining matrix,
Epetra_[Multi]Vector objects for the RHS and LHS, and a parameter list (read in
from an XML file, from the command line, or set in code) and you can then
access a significant serial and parallel, direct and iterative, linear solver
capability.  This talk will describe the real foundation for the Stratimikos
interface design which is Thyra.  Thyra is a set of abstract interfaces for
vectors, vector spaces, linear operators, linear solvers, and preconditioners
that support the development of advanced abstract numerical algorithms (ANAs).
In addition, Thyra also defines an interface to nonlinear
simulation-constrained models called the ModelEvaluator that was (and still is)
a major driver for the development of Stratimikos.  However, Stratimikos can be
used by less abstract clients by converting to and from Epetra and Thyra
objects.

"Belos:  A Framework for Next-generation Iterative Linear Solvers"
</h3>

Heidi Thornquist<br/>
Department of Electrical and Microsystems Modeling<br/>
Sandia National Laboratories<br/>

<p>
<u>Abstract</u><br/>
The solution of very large and sparse linear systems with multiple right-hand
sides is often required in modeling and simulation.  While many numerical
methods for solving these linear systems have been proposed in the literature,
Belos provides an iterative linear solver framework for developing and
delivering these methods to application codes.  In this talk we will discuss
interacting with Belos, from a user and developer standpoint, and the
available numerical methods for solving both single and multiple right-hand
side linear systems.

<h3>
"Physics-based preconditioners in Meros"
</h3>

Victoria E. Howle<br/>
Department of Mathematics and Statistics<br/>
Texas Tech University<br/>

<p>
<u>Abstract</u><br/>
Meros is a segregated preconditioning package that provides scalable
block preconditioning for problems that couple simultaneous solution
variables. Our initial focus has been on methods for solution of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Meros is available as part of
the Trilinos Project. This talk will give
an overview of the capabilities currently available in Meros as well as
plans for future development.

"Recent Algorithmic (and Practical) Developments in ML"
</h3>

Christopher M. Siefert<br/>
Scalable Algorithms Department<br/>
Sandia National Laboratories<br/>

<p>
<u>Abstract</u><br/>
We focus on several new algorithmic capabilities introduced in ML,
Trilinos' multilevel solvers package.  The first capability is a new
multilevel solver for compatible discretizations (edge elements) of the
eddy current Maxwell's equations.  This new solver, made available in
Trilinos 8.0, is based on an algebraic reformulation of the discrete
system, and has demonstrated successful weak parallel scaling up to 24,000
processors and 658 million unknowns.

The second capability enhances ML's existing repartitioning routines
through the hypergraph repartitioning available through Zoltan 3.0.  The
new algorithm accurately models communication costs in both the setup and
iterative phases to produce a better processor repartitioning.  This
feature is currently under development and will be released in Trilinos 9.0
in the fall.

We will also discuss some practical improvements designed to improve
the ML user experience, including validation of user input parameters.
