We introduce MNH, a new algorithm for unconstrained optimization when
derivatives are unavailable, primarily targeting applications that require
running computationally expensive deterministic simulations. MNH relies on
a trust-region framework with an underdetermined quadratic model that
interpolates the function at a set of data points.  We show how to
construct this interpolation set to yield computationally stable
parameters for the  model and, in doing so, obtain an algorithm which
converges to first-order critical points. Preliminary results are
encouraging and show that MNH makes effective use of the points evaluated
in the course of the optimization.
