In this paper, we give a framework 4D variational data assimilation (4D-Var) in Hilbert Spaces. In functional partial diï¬€erential equation setting, the adjoint equation method and Marchuk-Strang operator splitting are discussed. Convergence analysis of the operator splitting method is investigated for the functional 4D-Var.
