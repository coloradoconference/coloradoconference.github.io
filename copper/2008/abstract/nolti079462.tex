It is imperative for scientists and engineers of almost all fields to
have the tools to determine numerical solutions to Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs) efficiently and effectively. Adaptive solution
techniques are heavily utilized to approximate many of these PDEs needing
to concentrate computational efforts in some local regions. This
presentation focuses on
a methodology for adaptive local refinement such that, both error
reduction and work are taken into account to determine what elements to
refine. We strive to reach a certain approximation accuracy with the
least amount of effort. The first-order system least squares (FOSLS)
finite element methods complement the adaptive methodology, in that, it
delivers a quick and effective local a posteriori error indication. The
sequence of refined grids are solved in a full-multigrid context using
algebraic multigrid. The combination of FOSLS, efficiency-based adaptive
refinement, and AMG, result in a very powerful tool for numerical
solutions of many PDEs.
