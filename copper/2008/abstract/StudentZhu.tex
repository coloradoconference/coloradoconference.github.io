This paper proves the robustness of the overlapping domain decomposition preconditioners for the finite element approximation of second order elliptic boundary value
problems with strongly discontinuous coefficients. By analyzing the
eigenvalue distribution of the preconditioned system, we prove that only a fixed number of eigenvalues may deteriorate with respect to the discontinuous jump or meshsize, and
all the other eigenvalues are bounded below and above nearly uniformly
with respect to the jump and meshsize. As a result, the asymptotic convergence rate of the preconditioned conjugate gradient methods is uniform with respect to the coefficients
and meshsize.
