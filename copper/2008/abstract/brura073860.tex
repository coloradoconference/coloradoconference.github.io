In this paper preconditioners for the Conjugate Gradient are studied to
solve the Newton system with symmetric positive definite Jacobian. In
particular, we define a sequence of preconditioners built by means of
BFGS rank-two updates. Optimality conditions are derived which guarantee
that the preconditioned matrices are not far from the identity in a
matrix norm. Some notes on the implementation of the
corresponding inexact Newton method are given and some numerical results
on a model problem illustrate the application of the proposed
preconditioners.
