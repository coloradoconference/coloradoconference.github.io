Applying smoothed aggregation multigrid (SA) to solve nonsymmetric
linear systems, $A {\bf x} = {\bf b}$, can be problematic due to a
lack of minimization principle in the coarse-grid corrections.   We
propose an approach that is based on approximately applying SA
to the symmetric
positive definite matrices $\sqrt{A^* A}$ or $\sqrt{A A^*}$.   These
matrices, however, are typically full and difficult to compute, and it
is therefore not computationally efficient to use these matrices
directly to form a coarse-grid correction. Our proposed approach
approximates these coarse-grid corrections by using smoothed
aggregation to accurately approximate
the right and left singular vectors of $A$ that
correspond to the lowest singular value.  These are used
to construct
the interpolation and restriction operators, respectively.
We present some preliminary two-level convergence theory
and numerical results.
