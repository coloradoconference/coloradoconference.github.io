This paper describes a generic low-rank incremental method for computing the dominant singular
triplets of a matrix via a single pass through the matrix. This work unifies several efforts previously
described in the literature. We tie the operation of the proposed method to a particular optimization-
based eigensolver. This allows the description of mechanisms for exploiting multiple passes through the
matrix. We conclude with some numerical experiments and a discussion on possible applications of the
method.
