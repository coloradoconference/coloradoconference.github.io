===ABSTRACT:
Iterative algorithms are typically implemented by a sequence of calls to simple computational kernels, such as the BLAS or their sparse equivalent.  Hybrid-parallelization of these kernels on clusters of nodes with multicore CPUs or GPGPUs has demonstrated performance gains for individual kernels. An iterative algorithm can realize a similar performance gain only if the programming model for calling a sequence of these kernels does not introduce significant overhead.  Such a programming model for hybrid-parallel kernels has been implemented in Trilinos’ ThreadPool library.  A simple CG iterative solver is implemented using the ThreadPool library and its hybrid-parallel performance is assessed.
