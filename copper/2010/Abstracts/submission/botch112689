===ABSTRACT:
A well-known problem in the computation of matrix functions is the lack
of a clear notion of a residual for many matrix functions.  Although
it is possible to define a residual for some matrix functions such as 
the inverse or the square root, for many important matrix functions including 
the matrix exponential, no natural notion for residials seems to exist.

In this paper, we introduce an approach which yields a natural definition
of the residuals for the matrix exponential.  The approach is based on an 
alternative formulation of the problem of computing $\exp(-A)$ or $\exp(-A)v$
for given $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$.
Based on the approach, we propose a new definition for the matrix exponential
residual.  We show how the obtained residual definition can be used to get
new stopping criteria in iterative methods for computing the matrix 
exponential.  This is done in the context of two groups of iterative methods.  
The first one is the Krylov
subspace methods, where we pay special attention to the recently proposed
shift-and-invert Lanczos/Arnoldi methods of Moret--Novati~(2004) and
van~den~Eshof--Hochbruck~(2006).  The proposed residual appears to satisfy 
a Galerkin condition in this case.  The second group is the Chebyshev 
polynomial methods as studied e.g.\ by Tal Ezer~(1989) and recently used by 
Benzi--Razouk~(2007) for sparse matrices with a rapid decay in entries.
