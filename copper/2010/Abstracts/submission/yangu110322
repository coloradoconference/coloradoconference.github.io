===ABSTRACT:
We investigate effectiveness of an acceleration method applied
to the modified Picard iteration for simulations of variably saturated flow. We solve nonlinear systems using both unaccelerated and accelerated modified Picard iteration as well as the Newton method. Since Picard iterations can be slow to
converge, the advantage of acceleration is to provide faster
convergence while maintaining advantages of the Picard method over the Newton method. Results indicate the accelerated method provides a robust solver with significant potential computational advantages.
