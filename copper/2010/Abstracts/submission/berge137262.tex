In this talk, we present a multiphysics advection-diffusion solver that
has been implemented using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL), a
royalty-free standard for developing cross-platform codes on accelerated
and multicore/manycore architectures. During the course of developing
this code several useful abstractions and techniques were identified.
Additionally, issues of how to incorporate OpenCL into existing
distributed-memory programming models using MPI have arisen. We will
discuss some of these techniques and possible models for large-scale
simulations.
