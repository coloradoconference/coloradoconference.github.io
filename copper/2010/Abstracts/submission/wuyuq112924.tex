We study a parallel algorithm for the simulation of blood flows in
arteries using a fully coupled system of PDEs consisting of
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and a linear elastic equation. The
system is discretized implicitly with a finite element method on
unstructured moving meshes. Because of the branching geometry in the
artery tree, the outflow boundary condition plays an interesting role in
the accuracy of the blood flow model. In this talk, we discuss a Schwarz
type preconditioner for solving the linearized Navier-Stokes equations
with resistive outflow condition and we compare its accuracy and
performance with the standard pressure type boundary condition.
