===ABSTRACT:
In this work we construct and analyze multigrid preconditioners for operators of the form \mbox{${\mathcal D}_{\lambda}+{\mathcal K}_h^*{\mathcal K}_h$}, where $D_{\lambda}$ is the multiplication with a relatively ``smooth'' discrete function $\lambda>0$ and ${\mathcal K}_h$ is a  discretization of a compact linear operator. These systems arise when applying interior point methods to the distributed optimal control problem \mbox{$\min_u\frac{1}{2}(|\!|{\mathcal K} u-f|\!|^2 +\beta|\!|u|\!|^2)$} with box constraints $\underline{u}\leqslant u\leqslant\overline{u}$ on the control $u$.  The presented preconditioning technique is  related to the one developed by Dr{\u a}g{\u a}nescu and Dupont  in~\cite{dradup} for the associated unconstrained problem, and is intended for large-scale problems.  As in~\cite{dradup}, the quality of the resulting preconditioners is shown to increase as the resolution $h\downarrow 0$ at a rate that is optimal with respect to $h$  if the meshes are uniform, but decreases as the smoothness of $\lambda$ declines.  We test this algorithm first on  a Tikhnov-regularized backward parabolic equation with $[0,1]$ constraints and then on the elliptic-constrained optimization problem 
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \begin{array}{cc}\vspace{7pt}
    \textnormal{minimize}& \frac{1}{2}|\!|y-f|\!|^2 +
    \frac{\beta}{2}|\!|u|\!|^2  \\ \textnormal{subj. to\ \ } &\Delta
    y=u\ ,\ y\in H_0^1(\Omega),\ \underline{u} \leqslant u \leqslant \overline{u}\
    \  a.e.
  \end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}
In both cases it is shown that the number of linear iterations per optimization step, as well as the total number of fine-scale matrix-vector multiplications is decreasing with increasing resolution, thus showing the method to be potentially very efficient for truly large-scale problems.

This is joint work with Cosmin Petra from the Argonne National Laboratory.
