Many real-world optimization problems involve discrete decisions in
addition to nonlinearities, giving rise to mixed-integer nonlinear
optimization problems.

We present recent advances in mixed-integer nonlinear optimization
methods that are based on inexact subproblem solves during the
branch-and-bound tree-search. Numerical results on a broad range of
large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems will be
presented.
