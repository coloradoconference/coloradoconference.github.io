===ABSTRACT:
This talk will present preliminary results for implementing adaptive mesh refinement in the PIXIE3D magnetohydrodynamics code. We will present results for an explicit RK23 time integration scheme with automatic time step adaptation in a model tearing mode problem. Time and progress permitting we will discuss initial results for fully implicit calculations with BDF2 also.
