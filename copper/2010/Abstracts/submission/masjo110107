===ABSTRACT:
 
The Inverse Sherman-Morrison factorization of an 
invertible matrix $A$, for a positive parameter $s$, is given by
\begin{equation*} 
s^{-1}I - {A}^{-1} =  s^{-2} Z_s D_s^{-1} V_s^T
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*} 
z_k=e_k-\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\frac{v_i^T e_k}{s r_i} z_i 
\ v_k=y_k-\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\frac{y^T_k z_i}{sr_i}v_i,
\ \text{and} \ r_k=1+y^T_kz_k/s=1+v^T_k e_k/s
\end{equation*}
for $k=1,2,\ldots,n$, where
$e_k$ and $y_k$ are
the columns of the identity matrix $I$ and $Y=A^T-sI$, respectively.

It is known that from this factorization some factors of the LDU factorization
can be recovered, at the same time the inverse factors of the LDU factorization
are already computed, as can be deduced from the following relations
\begin{equation*} 
 {D}=s^{-1}D_s, \quad  {U}= Z^{-1},
\quad V_s =  {U}^T  {D} - s {L}^{-T},
\end{equation*}

Since the ISM factorization is 
highly parametrizable we analyze also some relations of the factors for 
different choices of the parameter $s$, and relations with scaling of $A$.


We also present an algorithm (NBIF) to compute a preconditioner using the ISM factorization and
the dropping strategies of Bollh\"ofer, taking advantage of more deep relations between both factorizations.
We also prove existence properties of these preconditioners and present some numerical 
results.
