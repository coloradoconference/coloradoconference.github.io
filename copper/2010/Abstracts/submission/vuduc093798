===ABSTRACT:
We present a performance model-driven framework for automated
performance tuning (autotuning) of sparse matrix-vector multiply
(SpMV) on systems accelerated by graphics processing units (GPU). Our
study consists of two parts.

First, we describe several carefully hand-tuned SpMV implementations
for GPUs, identifying key GPU-specific performance limitations,
enhancements, and tuning opportunities. These implementations, which
include variants on classical blocked compressed sparse row (BCSR) and
blocked ELLPACK (BELLPACK) storage formats, match or exceed
state-of-the-art implementations. For instance, our best BELLPACK
implementation achieves up to 29.0 Gflop/s in single-precision and 15.7
Gflop/s in double-precision on the NVIDIA T10P multiprocessor (C1060),
enhancing prior state-of-the-art unblocked implementations (Bell and Garland, 2009)
by up to 1.8$\times$ and 1.5$\times$ for single- and double-precision respectively.

However, achieving this level of performance requires input
matrix-dependent parameter tuning. Thus, in the second part of this
study, we develop a performance model that can guide tuning. Like
prior autotuning models for CPUs (e.g., Im, Yelick, and Vuduc, 2004),
this model requires offline measurements and run-time estimation, but
more directly models the structure of multithreaded vector processors
like GPUs. We show that our model can identify the implementations
that achieve within 15\% of those found through exhaustive search.
