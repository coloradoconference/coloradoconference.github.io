===ABSTRACT:
Texture synthesis is used to replicate and construct larger images from smaller sample images.  Leveraging the framework of [1] we texture synthesize MFA sonar returns where the pixel space is taken to be range and bearing.  In [1] blocks are tiled in raster scan order so that their edge intersections satisfy an overlap constraint.  To accomplish this, a method of evaluating a set of blocks and randomly choosing a block satisfying the overlap constraint is performed.  We speed up this process by replacing this method with [2] where the input function to the conjugate gradient method is the overlapping constraint result.
