===ABSTRACT:
\newcommand{\T}{^T\!}
\newcommand{\norm}[1]{\|#1\|}


An iterative method is presented for solving linear systems $Ax=b$ and $\min \norm{Ax-b}_2$, with $A$ being large and sparse, or a fast linear operator. The method is based on the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization process. It is analytically equivalent to the standard method of MINRES applied to the normal equation $A\T Ax = A\T b$, so that the quantities $\norm{A\T r_k}$ are monotonically decreasing (where $r_k = b - Ax_k$ is the residual for the current iterate $x_k$). In practice we observe that $\norm{r_k}$ also decreases monotonically. Compared to LSQR, for which only  \norm{r_k}$ is monotonic, it is safer to terminate LSMR early.
