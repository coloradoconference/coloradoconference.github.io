===ABSTRACT:
    We consider the standard cell-centered discretization of the  
diffusion equation on a rectangle with discontinuous diffusion coefficient.
Previously we considered an extension of black box multigrid with a  
coarsening factor of three. For a coarsening factor of two, the  
standard application of black box multigrid has been to coarsen the  
logically rectangular grid. This approach does not preserve the cell  
structure on coarser grids, as one would wish to do for local grid  
refinement and other applications. If variational coarsening is  
employed, with interpolation being a generalization of bilinear  
interpolation, it is well known that the difference operator on the  
next coarser grid has a twenty-five point stencil. In this work we  
extend the difference operator on the cell-centers of the finest grid 
to be a difference operator on the underlying grid consisting of cell- 
centers, cell-vertices and cell-edges. For this extended operator we  
derive an operator-induced interpolation, which is used to coarsen  
variationally to a difference operator on the grid of cell-vertices.  
This second operator is coarsened in the standard black box multigrid 
fashion to the grid of coarse-grid cell centers. The resulting  
operator has a nine point stencil, and the resulting interpolation  
operator from coarse-grid cell-centers to fine grid cell-centers has  
the same stencil as bilinear interpolation while the restriction  
operator from fine grid cell-centers to coarse-grid cell-centers has  
the same stencil as the transpose of bilinear interpolation.
