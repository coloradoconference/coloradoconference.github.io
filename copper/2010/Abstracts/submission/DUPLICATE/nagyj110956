===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we consider large-scale separable nonlinear least squares
problems that arise in image processing applications.  We use a
Gauss-Newton method for the nonlinear solver, and LSQR for the
associated linear systems.  Two important issues need to be
considered: how to incorporate regularization (the underlying
continuous problem is ill-posed), and how to efficiently handle large
scale linear solvers with the Jacobian matrix.  This latter issue is
essential to making it worth using a Gauss-Newton method.  We discuss
these issues in the context of a specific imaging application called
multi-frame blind deconvolution.  We show that the Jacobian,
though dense, has an interesting structure that allows for very
efficient matrix-vector multiplications, as well as for construction
of effective preconditioners.
