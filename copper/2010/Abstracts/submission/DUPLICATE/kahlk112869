===ABSTRACT:
We develop an Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) cycling scheme based on the adaptive Bootstrap AMG 
framework. The approach we present adaptively computes a set of test vectors and then 
uses them to define interpolation.

The setup of the method consists of two parts. First, we introduce concept of
Least Squares Interpolation which allows us to define interpolation in an algebraic 
multigrid context that is solely based on a set of test vectors. In addition, we propose 
and analyze a Bootstrap process to enhance the set of test vectors used in the 
definition of Least Squares Interpolation in a multigrid fashion. We demonstrate 
that this setup procedure allows us to iteratively improve the multigrid hierarchy 
until suitable performance of the resulting method is achieved while retaining control over
the complexity of the multigrid hierarchy and overall setup costs. We present tests for 
a variety of applications that show the flexibility and robustness of this approach.
