Radiation hydrodynamics is a field that encompasses a collection of
exotic problems in exotic regimes. In this presentation, I will discuss
multiphysics problems and iterative solution techniques for simulations
of shock waves--both those in the laboratory and those of interest in an
astrophysical setting. The systems of interest are complex, evolving,
radiation-hydrodynamic, multiphysics environments with diverse distance
scales, time scales, physical regimes, species, and radiation-matter
couplings. The numerical models that result are of a scope that require
large-scale parallel computing. Preconditioned Newton-Krylov methods are
especially effective in making these problems computationally tractable.
