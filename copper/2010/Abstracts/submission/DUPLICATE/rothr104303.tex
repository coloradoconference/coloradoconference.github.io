We describe a systematic way to generate adjoint code by applying an
efficient sparsity exploiting forward mode of Automatic Differentiation
to the original code. The result is a linear system for the adjoint that
can be solved by taking advantage of the original code.
The structure of a parallel solver can be used for the AD, which gives
rise to a parallel distribution of the adjoint linear system. Reusage of
a multigrid structure is also possible.

This procedure has been applied to the finite volume, parallel,
block-structured, multigrid flow solver FASTEST, which can also run Large
Eddy Simulations and is written in Fortran. Numerical results of
engineering applications will be presented.
