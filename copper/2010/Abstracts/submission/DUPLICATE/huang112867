===ABSTRACT:
We consider the problem of estimating signal priors, which are used in the $\ell_1$-regularization and the resulting inverse problem has a stabilized solution. From a Bayesian viewpoint, we first define a multivariate $\ell_1$-Laplace density function
and then solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added
$\ell_1$-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but
the memory requirements and the nonlinear non-smooth sub-gradient
equations are prohibitive for large-scale problems. We develop an
iterative algorithm to efficiently solve such large problems and
demonstrate the selected priors generally behave better than those
commonly used ones in the signal processing.
