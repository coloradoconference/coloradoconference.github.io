We propose and analyze a new GPS positioning algorithm. Our algorithm
uses direct linearization technique to reduce the computation time
overhead. We invoke the general least squares method instead of the
ordinary least square method in order to achieve optimality in the
situation. We systematically evaluate our new algorithms and show that
they do indeed take much less
computation time than the traditional GPS method while maintaining
reasonable accuracy. Numerical examples verify our claims.
