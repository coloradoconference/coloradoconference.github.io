===ABSTRACT:
We propose and analyze a new GPS positioning algorithm. Our algorithm uses direct linearization technique to reduce the computation time overhead. We invoke the general least squares method instead of the ordinary least square method in order to achieve optimality in the situation. We systematically evaluate our new algorithms and show that they do indeed take much less 
computation time than the traditional GPS method while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Numerical examples verify our claims.
