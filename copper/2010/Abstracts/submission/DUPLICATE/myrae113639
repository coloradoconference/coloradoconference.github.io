===ABSTRACT:
Radiation hydrodynamics is a field that encompasses a collection of exotic problems in exotic regimes.  In this presentation, I will discuss multiphysics problems and iterative solution techniques for simulations of shock waves--both those in the laboratory and those of interest in an astrophysical setting.  The systems of interest are complex, evolving, radiation-hydrodynamic, multiphysics environments with diverse distance scales, time scales, physical regimes, species, and radiation-matter couplings.  The numerical models that result are of a scope that require large-scale parallel computing.  Preconditioned Newton-Krylov methods are especially effective in making these problems computationally tractable.
