===ABSTRACT:
We develop a Stieltjes-Lanczos procedure for a symmetric, positive definite parameterized matrix $A(s)$ and a given
parameterized vector $b(s)$. Each element in $A(s)$ and $b(s)$ is assumed to be a bounded and continuous
function of a set of parameters $s\in\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. 
The method computes a \emph{constant} tridiagonal matrix whose eigenvalues approximate the parameterized spectrum of
$A(s)$. We show how this can be interpreted as constructing a Gaussian quadrature formula for a Riemann integral of the
form $\langle b^Tf(A)b \rangle$, where $f(\cdot)$ is an analytic function and $\langle\cdot\rangle$ denotes
integration over the parameter space. 
We also apply this procedure to iteratively approximate the vector-valued function $x(s)$ that solves
$A(s)x(s)=b(s)$; such problems commonly arise within discretizations of partial differential equations with
stochastic inputs. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided which validate the theory and suggest future
directions for research.
