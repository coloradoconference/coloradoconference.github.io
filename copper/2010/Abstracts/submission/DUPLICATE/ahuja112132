===ABSTRACT:
Science and engineering problems frequently require solving a
sequence of dual linear systems, $A_k x_k = b_k$ and $A^{H}_k
y_k = c_k$. Two examples are the Iterative Rational Krylov
Algorithm for model reduction and Quantum Monte Carlo methods
in electronic structure calculations. This talk introduces
Recycling BiCG, a BiCG method that recycles two Krylov
subspaces from one pair of linear systems to the next pair. The
recycle spaces are approximate left and right invariant
subspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues close to the origin.
The recycle spaces are found by solving a small generalized
eigenvalue problem alongside the dual linear systems being
solved in the sequence.

We develop a generalized bi-Lanczos algorithm, where the two
matrices of the bi-Lanczos procedure are not each other's
conjugate transpose, but satisfy this relation over the
generated Krylov subspaces. This is sufficient for a short term
recurrence. Next, we derive an augmented bi-Lanczos algorithm
with recycling and show that this algorithm is a special case
of the generalized bi-Lanczos algorithm. The Petrov-Galerkin
approximation that includes recycling of the Krylov subspaces
leads to modified two-term recurrences for the solution and
residual updates.

We test our algorithm in three application areas. First, we
solve a discretized partial differential equation of
convection-diffusion type, because these are well-known model
problems. Second, we use Recycling BiCG for the linear systems
arising in the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm for model
reduction, which requires solving a sequence of slowly
changing, dual linear systems. Third, we consider Quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) methods for electronic structure calculations.
Although QMC methods could solve a single system at each step
in the Monte Carlo sequence, solving dual systems reduces the
number of iterations for the same accuracy. Our experiments
with Recycling BiCG give promising results.
