An optimal control problem governed by an elliptic variational inequality
of the first kind and bilateral control constraints is studied. A smooth
penalization technique for the variational inequality is applied and
convergence of stationary
points of the subproblems to an E-almost C-stationary point of the limit
problem is shown. The subproblems are solved using a full approximation
multigrid scheme (FAS) and alternatively a multigrid method of the second
kind for which a convergence result is given. An overall algorithmic
concept is provided and its performance
is discussed by means of examples.
