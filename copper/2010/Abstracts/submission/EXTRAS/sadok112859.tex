CMRH (Changing Minimal Residual method based on the Hessenberg process)is
a Krylov subspace method which uses the Hessenberg process to produce a
basis of a Krylov method, and minimizes a quasi-residual. The CMRH method
shares many of the computational properties of the well-known GMRES
method.

Hence this method produces convergence curves which are very close
to those of GMRES, but using fewer operations and storage.
In this paper we present new analysis which explains
why CMRH has this good convergence behavior.
