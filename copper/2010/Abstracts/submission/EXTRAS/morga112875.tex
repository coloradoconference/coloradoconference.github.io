We look at the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm for computing eigenvalues
and both right and left eigenvectors. We give an approach that uses
restarting to limit storage. The crucial topic of roundoff error control
will be investigated. Also relationships will be discussed to implicitly
restarted Arnoldi, thick restart Lanczos and GMRES-DR. One application is
to solution of nonsymmetric systems of linear equations with multiple
right-hand sides.
