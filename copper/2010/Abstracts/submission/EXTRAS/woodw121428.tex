With the ability to simulate complex models of subsurface, surface, and
lower atmospheric flows, recent attention has been focused on
understanding feedbacks between these regimes. In this talk, we will
present our work in combining a variably saturated subsurface flow model
with surface and lower atmospheric models with the goal of enhancing wind
prediction and understanding climate change impacts. We will motivate the
work with these two application areas, then discuss our simulation
capabilities and some of the challenges we face.
