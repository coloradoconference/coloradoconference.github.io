In this talk, PDE-constrained optimal control problems with state
constraints are considered. A particular difficulty with state
constraints is that the optimality system contains complementarity
conditions between a function in a nice space, e.g., $C(\bar\Omega)$, and
a generalized function in the dual space, e.g., the space of Borel
measures.
A general approach to tackle this situation is to introduce a suitable
family of regularized problems and to follow the path af regularized
solutions towards the solution of the state-constrained problem.
In this talk, we investigate a class of regularization methods for state
constrained optimal problems that is related to penalty barrier
multiplier methods as well as to the Moreau-Yosida regularization.
We investigate the convergence of this class of methods and develop error
estimates. The presented results are also applicable to related settings
such as obstacle problems. The talk is concluded by numerical results.
