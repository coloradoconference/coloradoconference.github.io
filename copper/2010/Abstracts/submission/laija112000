===ABSTRACT:
We propose an algebraic multigrid (AMG) method for systems discretized by high order $H$(curl) elements.  Standard AMG methods perform poorly on these problems because of the large null space of the curl operator.  We use hierarchical high order $H$(curl) conforming elements.  Our algorithm combines ideas from $p$-multigrid and AMG for edge elements to obtain a  high order AMG method.   The initial levels in our hierarchy are constructed by discretizing the problem for decreasing orders of $p$.  Since we use a hierarchical basis, the integrid transfer operators are trivial.  To address complexity issues, we do not visit every $p$ in our hierarchy.  After $p=0$ is reached, we apply smoothed aggregation AMG for edge elements.  We conclude with numerical results for the proposed AMG algorithm applied to the 2D eddy current problem for bases up to order $p=9$.
