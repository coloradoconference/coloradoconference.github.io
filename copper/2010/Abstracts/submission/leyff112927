===ABSTRACT:
Many real-world optimization problems involve discrete decisions in addition to nonlinearities, giving rise to mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems. 

We present recent advances in mixed-integer nonlinear optimization methods that are based on inexact subproblem solves during the branch-and-bound tree-search. Numerical results on a broad range of large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems will be presented.
