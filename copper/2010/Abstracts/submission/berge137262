===ABSTRACT:
In this talk, we present a multiphysics advection-diffusion solver that has been implemented using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL), a royalty-free standard for developing cross-platform codes on accelerated and multicore/manycore architectures.  During the course of developing this code several useful abstractions and techniques were identified.  Additionally, issues of how to incorporate OpenCL into existing distributed-memory programming models using MPI have arisen.  We will discuss some of these techniques and possible models for large-scale simulations.
