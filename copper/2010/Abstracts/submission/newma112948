===ABSTRACT:
We discuss a method for coupling the Laplace-Beltrami mesh smoothing equations
to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The method is based on implicit/explicit treatment of the coupled PDES and 
solved using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method interleaved
with an error indicator for the mesh smoothing process.

We present numerical examples to support this study and provide comparison to 
fully coupled methods.
