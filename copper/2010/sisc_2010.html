<h3>Call for Papers - SISC Copper Mountain Special Issue</h3>

The 11th Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods is scheduled from
April 4 - April 9, 2010 
(<a href="http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2010"> http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2010</a>). 
As in previous even-numbered years, a Special Issue of SIAM Journal 
on Scientific Computing (SISC) is planned.  This single issue will be 
dedicated to recent progress in iterative methods.  Submissions are 
encouraged in all aspects of iterative methods including the following 
highlighted areas: 
stochastic PDEs
and uncertainty, page rank and Markov chains, inverse problems and
regularization, optimization, PDE systems, hardware effects/multicore
architectures, and nonlinear solvers and applications.
<p>
The deadline for submission to the Special Issue is <b>June 15, 2008</b>. 
Attendees and participants of the conference as well as the general 
community are invited to submit papers.

<p>
Submissions should be made using the ordinary SISC submission process with a
statement in the cover letter requesting that the paper be considered for the
Special Issue on iterative methods.  All interested should submit a manuscript
and cover letter in PDF format via SISC's online submission site at
<a href="http://sisc.siam.org/">http://sisc.siam.org</a>. 
Note the block labeled Special Section (just under the
keywords block on your submission screen) and select
"Copper Mountain Special Issue 2008" from the dropdown box. Also be sure to
note in the Manuscript Comment text box at the bottom of this page that your
work is intended for the Copper Mountain Special Issue.  Papers will be subject
to review by a guest Editorial Board.

<p>
