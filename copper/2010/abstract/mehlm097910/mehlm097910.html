<P>
From a computer science point of view, the performance evaluation of
iterative solvers for large systems of equations
does not only include numerical efficiency but also parallel
scalability. Whereas multigrid methods are clearly superior from
a pure numerical point of view, the majority of parallel solvers
available in software packages are
based on cg-like methods.
These solvers achieve very good scalability on high performance
computing platforms even for large processors numbers. In contrast,
multigrid methods seem to perform much worse in the parallel context.
This arises the question whether they are only a nice theoretical
concept but not applicable in an efficient way in supercomputing
practice.

<P>
Considerations that might lead to such a conclusion often only include
so-called strong-scalability results -- constant problem size and
growing number of processors.
This point of view does not take into account the advantage of
multigrid methods -- the constant number of iterations with
increasing problem size.
Thus, the correct setting must be to consider weak-scalability, that
is problem sizes growing according to the processor number, and, in
addition, time until convergence instead of only single solver
iterations.

<P>
This approach leads to a new definition of an optimal solver.
Whereas an optimal sequential
solver computes the solution of a system in a computational
time growing proportional to the number of unknowns,
parallelisation even allows to look for solvers with
constant computational time.
So the question is: Is it possible
to implement a solver that solves a system of equations in constant
time independent from the size of the system or the mesh resolution,
respectively, by suitably increasing the number of processors?
In the optimal case, the number of processors increaes only proportional
to the problem size.

<P>
We will present first a theoretical
comparison of cg-like and multigrid methods for parallel computations
under simplifying assumptions showing the general potential of
multigrid and cg-like solvers on supercomputers and also
answering the question on the possibility to develop an optimal
parallel solver. In addition, we will relate various parallel
multigrid approaches from literature (see for example
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]) to this theoretical analysis
and, finally, present results from an own parallel multigrid
implementation on adaptive Cartesian grids with tree-structure
(see [5] for a decription of the corresponding
sequential code).
In contrast to the purely theoretical analysis that only takes into
account computational and communication costs, this will also give
hints on ways to improve other performance aspects such as
cache-efficiency that can be an additional stumbling block
for high performance multigrid implementations due to the more
complex data dependencies compared to cg-like solvers.
