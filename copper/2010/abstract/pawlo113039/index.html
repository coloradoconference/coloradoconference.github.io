Multiphysics simulation is plagued by complexity stemming from
nonlinearly coupled systems of PDEs. Such software often must support
many physics models, each of which may require different discretizations,
transport equations, constitutive models, and equations of state.
Additionally, the use of sophisticated solution and analysis algorithms
may impose a burden on users that wish to extend the physics models.
Strong coupling, together with a multiplicity of models, often leads to
complex algorithms and rigid software.

<P>
This talk will discuss a new paradigm where the focus is shifted from the
high level algorithmic design to a low level data dependency design.
Mathematical expressions are represented as objects in software that
directly expose data dependencies. The entire system of expressions are
represented as a directed acyclic graph and the high-level assembly
algorithm is generated automatically through standard graph theory
algorithms. This approach allows problems with very complex dependencies
to become entirely tractable, and removes virtually all logic from the
algorithm itself. Changes are highly localized, allowing model developers
to implement code without requiring a detailed understanding of the
algorithms. By leveraging embedded technology, applications can probe the
expressions to generate auxiliary data including machine precision
accurate sensitivities for solution algorithms. The localized design
allows for a number of levels of optimization for large-scale parallel
computers utilizing both MPI and multithreading. We will discuss the
design of the library, the use of embedded technology and show results
from production large-scale computations in the areas of
magnetohydrodynamics and semiconductor device modeling.
