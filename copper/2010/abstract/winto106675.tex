Our goal is to estimate the parameters, specifically hydraulic
conductivity, that determine subsurface groundwater flow in saturated
domains. Modeling such flow can be computationally intense; large models
have unknowns numbering in the tens of millions. Our research constructs
a reduced order model (ROM) using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD).
This POD model will reduce the degrees of freedom from millions of
unknowns to tens. We will use PEST (Parameter ESTimation) as our
optimization software. The model software, ADH, is under development at
ERDC in Vicksburg, MS. Our results on 3-D domains demonstrate an order of
magnitude fewer calls to the full, expensive model without sacrificing
accuracy in the final solution.
