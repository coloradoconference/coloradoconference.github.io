Recently, significant progress has been made in developing scalable
implicit methods for time integration of resistive and extended MHD
time integration. These methods use inexact Newton solves and
physics-based preconditioning for the inner linear solves. As opposed
to algebraic linear solvers, for which optimized high-performance
kernels exist and are reusable across a large class of problems, these
new methods employ matrix-free (or matrix-light) algorithms. As a
simple example, GMRES only needs to perform Jacobian-vector products,
which can be approximated as finite-difference directional
derivatives. Therefore, this new class of algorithms spends a major
part of its computational time in problem-specific r.h.s. evaluations.

<P>
Automatic code generation is a technique that takes the specification
of an algorithm at a higher abstraction level and creates a well-tuned
implementation from it. For finite-volume / finite-difference based
discretizations, this higher abstraction level can be a stencil
computation, which needs to be performed at every grid point in the
integration domain. It could also be specified at an even higher level
closer to the mathematical description of the problem, for example by
defining the fluxes and leaving the implementation of the discrete
divergence to the code generator. At the backend, a code generator can
feature different modules which generate optimal code for specific
hardware architectures, for example conventional architectures (x86)
but using SIMD instructions (e.g. SSE2), or accelerator-based
architectures like the Cell processor or GPGPUs. The problem-specific
code (in this example, the discretized system of equations) can be
agnostic to the actual hardware used, a high-performance
implementation tailored to the specific architecture will be generated
automatically. While a conventionally written code will typically only
achieve a couple percent of peak performance, the automatically
generated version can improve performance by a factor of four or more
even on conventional hardware, and provide even higher gains on
accelerator-based machines.
