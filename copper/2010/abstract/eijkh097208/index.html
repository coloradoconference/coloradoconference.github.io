<P>
In a series of papers, it has been shown that from the mere
mathematical specification of a target operation it is possible to
systematically and even mechanically derive families of loop-based
algorithms for dense linear algebra operations. A framework named
FLAME (Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment) has been developed
to realize this aim. FLAME starts with a non-algorithmic specification
of the inputs and outputs of an operation; in the case of matrix
inversion this would state that the output is the inverse of the
input. Once the algebraic description is written as a Partitioned
Matrix Expression (PME), it becomes possible to choose an invariant
that is to hold in each iteration of the loop-based algorithm, for
instance declaring that parts of the result have been computed.

<P>
This talk will first of all show how the FLAME methodology, so far mostly
applied to direct dense matrix algorithms, can be applied to
vector-oriented iterative processes such as Krylov space methods. For
this we use the block formulation of iterative methods, going back to
Householder, and reason in terms of matrices that comprise the vectors
computed. The PME for an iterative method then describes the basic
generating relations between the vectors, as well as the condition of
orthogonality. We show that from this high level description we
can derive specific methods. We will also show that it is possible to
derive multiple algorithms from the same PME.

<P>
Secondly, we will establish that the reasoning outlined so far
can be made sufficiently
systematic that mechanical derivation, complete with correctness
proof, is within reach. We show that the derivation of the essential
steps in a method is in fact driven by the generation of Hoare
triples, a central tool proving correctness of algorithms.

<P>
Thus, this research makes a case for the feasibility of
mechanical generation of proved correct algorithms and corresponding
library software for iterative methods for solving linear systems.
