<P>
Many applications in science and engineering lead to models which require
solving large-scale fixed point problems, or equivalently, systems of
nonlinear equations. Several successful techniques for handling such
problems are based on quasi-Newton methods that implicitly update the
approximate Jacobian or inverse Jacobian to satisfy a certain secant
condition.

<P>
We present two classes of multisecant methods which allows to take
into account a variable number of secant equations at each iteration. The
first is the Broyden-like class, of which Broyden's family is a subclass,
and Anderson mixing is a particular member. The second class is that of
the nonlinear Eirola-Nevanlinna-type methods.

<P>
This work was motivated by a problem in electronic structure
calculations, whereby a fixed point iteration, known as the
self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, is accelerated by various
strategies termed `mixing'.
