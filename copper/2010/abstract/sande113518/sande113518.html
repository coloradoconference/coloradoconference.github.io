A recursive acceleration method is proposed for multiplicative multilevel aggregation
algorithms that calculate the stationary probability vector of large,
sparse and irreducible Markov chains. Pairs of consecutive iterates at
all branches and levels of a multigrid W-cycle with simple,
non-overlapping aggregation are recombined to produce improved iterates
at those levels, in an approach that is inspired by so-called k-cycle
(Krylov-cycle) methods. The acceleration is achieved by solving quadratic
programming problems with inequality constraints: the linear combination
of the two iterates is sought that has minimal two-norm residual, under
the constraint that all vector components are nonnegative. It is shown
how the two-dimensional quadratic programming problems can be solved
explicitly in an efficient way. The method is further enhanced by
windowed top-level acceleration of the W cycles using the same
constrained quadratic programming approach. Recursive acceleration is an
attractive alternative to smoothing the restriction and interpolation
operators, since the operator complexity is better controlled and the
probabilistic interpretation of coarse-level operators is maintained on
all levels. Numerical results are presented showing that the resulting
recursively accelerated multilevel aggregation cycles for Markov chains,
combined with top-level acceleration, converge signifficantly faster
than W cycles, and lead to close-to-linear computational complexity for
challenging test problems.
