We consider pricing options in jump-diffusion models which require
solving partial integro-differential equations. Discretizing by the
central spatial finite difference scheme leads to linear systems of
ordinary differential equations with Toeplitz structure. A fast
exponential time integration scheme, where the shift-invert Arnoldi
method is employed for the Toeplitz matrix exponential, is proposed to
approximate the solutions of those systems. Numerical results are given
to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
