Multiphysics applications are characterized by strongly-nonlinear coupled
physical mechanisms that produce a solution with a wide-range of length
and time scales. As a result, developing effective preconditioners for
these systems can be a formidable challenge. One approach, which has
demonstrated some success in a range of multiphysics applications (low
Mach number CFD, reacting flow, drift-diffusion simulations and low Mach
number resistive MHD), is a multigrid method with incomplete
factorization smoothing. The coarsening is an aggressive graph-based
aggregation applied to the nonzero block structure of the Jacobian
matrix. These techniques have been shown to have favorable scaling
properties for a number of nearly-elliptic systems. However, it is an
open question on how robust and efficient these methods will be as the
physics increases in complexity or progresses towards the hyperbolic
limit.

<P>
An alternative approach is to use approximate block factorizations for
preconditioning of multiphysics systems. These methods segregate the
linear operator into different sub-matrices based on the components of
the physics. These individual components are typically more amenable to
black-box AMG technology. The difficulty with this approach is that an
effective approximation of the physical coupling embodied in the Schur
complement operator is required. For the Navier-Stokes equations this has
been a very active area of study. The approaches have included the basic
physics-based SIMPLE solution method to more sophisticated techniques
based on commuting arguments, such as the pressure-convection diffusion
or least-squares commutator preconditioners.

<P>
In this talk performance results for both preconditioning techniques are
compared. Several applications are considered, including Navier-Stokes
and compressible and incompressible Magnetohydrodyanamics. The specific
Schur complement approximations as well as the implementation of these
methods in the recently developed Trilinos software package ``Teko'' will
be discussed.
