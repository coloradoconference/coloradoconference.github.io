We investigate effectiveness of an acceleration method applied
to the modified Picard iteration for simulations of variably saturated
flow. We solve nonlinear systems using both unaccelerated and accelerated
modified Picard iteration as well as the Newton method. Since Picard
iterations can be slow to
converge, the advantage of acceleration is to provide faster
convergence while maintaining advantages of the Picard method over the
Newton method. Results indicate the accelerated method provides a robust
solver with significant potential computational advantages.
