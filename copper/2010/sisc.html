<h3>Call for Papers - SISC Copper Mountain Special Issue</h3>

The 11th Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods is scheduled from
April 4 - April 9, 2010 
(<a href="http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2010">http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2010</a>). 
As in previous even-numbered years, a Special Issue of SIAM Journal on Scientific
Computing (SISC) is planned.  This single issue will be dedicated to recent
progress in iterative methods.  Submissions are encouraged in all aspects of
iterative methods including the following highlighted areas: 
<!-- 
    stochastic PDEs and uncertainty, page rank and Markov chains, 
    inverse problems and regularization, optimization, PDE systems, 
    hardware effects/multicore architectures, and nonlinear solvers and applications.
-->
<ul>
<li> <b> Robustness of algebraic multigrid,</b> including convergence
         analysis and sequences of systems.

<li> <b> Algebraic multilevel methods outside of partial differential equations:</b>
         including large-scale information analysis, statistical analysis,
         image recognition, and quantum chromodynamics.

<li> <b> Advanced architectures:</b> including multicore applications,
         distributed/shared memory algorithms, and data structures.

<li> <b> Stochastic partial differential equations and uncertainty quantification:</b>
         including efficient algorithms for handling UQ, discretization,
         and effects of nonlinearity.

<li> <b> Large-scale optimization and inverse problems:</b>
         including interior point methods, PDE constrained optimization,
         and sequential programming.

<li> <b> Homogenization/upscaling:</b> including multiscale methods and the
         use of multigrid and domain decomposition principles.
<li> <b> Environmental science & energy applications, </b>
         including atmosphere, ocean, ice modeling, wind energy, and fusion.
<li> <b> Nonlinear solvers and applications, </b> including Newton-Krylov
         and FAS schemes, sensitivity analysis, and Jacobian approximations.
</ul>

<p>
The deadline for submission to the Special Issue is <b>June 15, 2010</b>. 
Attendees and participants of the conference as well as the general 
community are invited to submit papers.

<p>
Submissions should be made using the ordinary SISC submission process with a
statement in the cover letter requesting that the paper be considered for the
Special Issue on iterative methods.  All interested should submit a manuscript
and cover letter in PDF format via SISC's online submission site at
<a href="http://www.siam.org/journals/sisc.php">http://www.siam.org/journals/sisc.php</a>. 
Note the block labeled Special Section 
(just under the keywords block on your submission screen) 
and select "Copper Mountain Special Issue 2010" from the dropdown box. 
Also be sure to note in the Manuscript Comment text box at the bottom of this 
page that your work is intended for the Copper Mountain Special Issue.  
Papers will be subject to review by a guest Editorial Board.

<p>
