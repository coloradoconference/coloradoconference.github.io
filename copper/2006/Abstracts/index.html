<body bgcolor="#00ffff"> 
<h2>SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS</h2>  

In order to guarantee a spot in the program,
each speaker is asked to submit an abstract,
in plain text or LaTeX form, on the
<a href="Submit.html"><b>Abstract Submission web page</b></a>.
The abstract must not exceed 1000 words or two pages.

<p>
We will provide a printed collection of abstracts to the participants
at the conference. It will include the abstracts together
with a schedule and important notices. This should make it easier
to select which lectures and special sessions to attend. 

<p>
Abstracts will only be accepted from the <em>intended speaker</em>.
In the list of papers that we will eventually post,
we will include the name of the person who submitted
the abstract as the speaker along with a link
to the email address used in the submission.

<p>
Expanded abstracts, preferably in PDF form,
can be as long as you want; submit them
to the <a href="#vp">MGNet Virtual Proceedings</a>.



<h2>STUDENT PAPERS</h2>
Student papers are due <b>January 10, 2006</b>.
They should be submitted as a PDF format attachment
in an email message to 
<tt>copper@colorado.edu</tt>.
Students whose papers are accepted will be asked
to submit abstracts in due time.
At the time of submission, please include in your email
a statement identifying the paper as a Student Paper.
For more information see
<a href="../student.html">Student Paper Competition</a>.
