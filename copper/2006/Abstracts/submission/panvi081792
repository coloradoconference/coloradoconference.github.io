===ABSTRACT:
Multiplicative preconditioners are popular for solving linear systems of 
equations. We introduce additive preconditioners, which are more robust 
and more readily available. By combining them with aggregation processes, 
we obtain preconditioners that are nearly as effective as SVD-based 
multiplicative preconditioners. Besides simplifying and stabilizing 
the generation of such preconditioners, this technique also preserves
the structure of the input matrices, and we also employ it for numerical
computation of the sign of the matrix determinant. Our alternative 
techniques employ additive preconditioners for computing null vectors 
and null space bases for a singular matrix, and we extend this approach 
to yield alternative linear solvers and to compute the tails of the SVDs 
of ill conditioned matrices and matrix eigenvectors. We support our approach
with extensive analysis and numerical experiments.
