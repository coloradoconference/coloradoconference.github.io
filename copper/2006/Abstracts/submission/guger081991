===ABSTRACT:
Dynamical systems are the basic framework for modeling and control
of an enormous variety of complex systems. Direct numerical simulation of the associated models
 has been one of the  few available means when goals include accurate prediction
or control of complex physical phenomena. However, the ever
increasing need for improved accuracy requires the inclusion of ever
more detail in the modeling stage, leading inevitably to ever
larger-scale, ever more complex dynamical systems.

Simulations in such large-scale settings can be overwhelming and
make unmanageably large demands on computational resources, which is
the main motivation for model reduction. The goal of model reduction is
to produce a much lower dimensional system having the same
input/output characteristics as the original. Recently, Krylov-based methods have emerged
as promising candidates for reduction of large-scale dynamical systems.


The main cost in Krylov-based model reduction is due to solving
a set of linear systems of the form $(s_o \mathbf{I}_n - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}$
where $\mathbf{A}$ is an ${n \times n}$  matrix, $\mathbf{b}$ is an $n$-dimensional
vector, $s_0$ is a complex number called the {\it  interpolation point} and $\mathbf{I}_n$
is the identity matrix of size $n$.
Since the need for more detail and
accuracy in the modeling stage  causes the system dimension, $n$,
to reach levels on the order of millions, direct solvers for
the linear system $(s_o \mathbf{I}_n - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}$  are no longer
feasible; hence inexact solves need to be employed in Krylov-based model
reduction.

In this talk, we investigate the  use of inexact solves in a Krylov-based model reduction setting
and present the resulting perturbation effects on the underlying model reduction problem.
We show that for a \emph{good} selection of interpolation points, Krylov-based model reduction is robust
with respect to the perturbations due to inexact solves. On the other hand, when the interpolation points are
\emph{poorly} selected, these perturbations are magnified through the model reduction process.
We also examine stopping criteria,  effective preconditioning,  and restarting  techniques
in the particular context of model reduction. Finally, we incorporate
inexact solves for the Krylov-based optimal ${\cal H}_2$  approximation. The result is
an effective optimal model reduction algorithm applicable in realistic large-scale settings.
