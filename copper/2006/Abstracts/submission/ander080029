===ABSTRACT:
We study a time parallel space-time finite element approach
for the nonhomogeneous wave equation using a continuous time Galerkin method and a time decomposition strategy for preconditioning.

  Space-time finite elements provide some natural
advantages for numerical relativity in black hole simulations.
With space-time elements, time-varying computational
domains are straightforward, higher-order approaches
are easily formulated, and both time and spatial domains can be
discretized using a more general mesh.

  We present fully implicit examples in $1+1$, $2+1$, and $3+1$ dimensions using linear quadrilateral, hexahedral, and tesseractic elements. Krylov solvers with additive Schwarz preconditioning are
used for solving the linear system.  We introduce a time decomposition strategy in preconditioning which significantly improves performance when compared with unpreconditioned cases.  Parallel performance results are also given.
