An approach is described for model reduction of second-order systems
with types of normal mode damping that include the most common
varieties: proportional damping and square-root damping.
We show that unlike the general case that requires usage
of a second-order Krylov subspace structure, one can build up instead
approximating subspaces satisfying all required conditions much
more cheaply as direct sums of standard rational Krylov subspaces
within much smaller component subspaces.
We give a detailed analysis of the distribution of system poles,
and then, through descriptive bounds that carry the flavor of classical
approximation theory, we are able to exploit the structure of these
poles to obtain asymptotically optimal shift selection strategies.
Numerical examples are provided to illustrate and support the analysis.
