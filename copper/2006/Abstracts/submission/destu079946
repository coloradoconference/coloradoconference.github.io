===ABSTRACT:
Many problems in science and engineering require the solution of a long sequence of linear systems, with small changes from one matrix to the next but substantial changes over multiple systems. We are particularly interested in cases where both the matrix and the right hand side change and systems are not available simultaneously. Such sequences arise in time-dependent iterations, nonlinear systems of equations and optimization, (distributed) parameter identification
and inverse problems, and many other problems.

In recent papers [1,2,3] we have
proposed methods to recycle selected subspaces from the Krylov
spaces generated for previous linear systems to improve the
convergence of subsequent linear systems. In this presentation, we discuss several important convergence issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item the convergence of Krylov methods that recycle approximate
solution spaces, approximate invariant subspaces, and other relevant spaces,

\item the relevant perturbation theory for the spaces mentioned above for sequences of matrices arising in a range of applications, 

\item how fast our proposed methods learn to adapt to a changing
problem.
\end{itemize}
We provide experimental results for a range of problems from
tomography, nonlinear mechanics, large-scale design optimization, and statistical mechanics.
