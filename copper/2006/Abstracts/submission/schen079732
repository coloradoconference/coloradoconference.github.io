===ABSTRACT:
One of the hardest challenges in modern eigenvalue computation is the
numerical solution of large-scale eigenvalue problems, in particular those
arising from quantum physics such as the Anderson model of localization
[4]. Typically, these problems require the computation of some
interior eigenvalues and eigenvectors for systems which have up to several
million unknowns due to their high spatial dimensions. Furthermore, their
underlying structure involves random perturbations of matrix elements which
invalidates simple preconditioning approaches.

We propose an efficient preconditioning algorithm for this Anderson model of
localization [6]. The model requires the computation of a few interior
eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors for large scale, sparse, real
and symmetric indefinite matrices. Our preconditioning approach for the
associated shift-and-invert systems is based on maximum weighted matchings
[3,5] and algebraic multilevel, inverse-based incomplete $LDL^T$
factorizations [1,2]. Our numerical examples indicate that recent algebraic
multilevel preconditioning solvers can accelerative the computation of the
underlying large-scale eigenvalue problem by several orders of magnitude
compared with previous approaches [4,6].
