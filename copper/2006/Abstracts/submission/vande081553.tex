We will discuss a multigrid solver for the numerical solution of the
time-dependent Sylvester equation
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dX}{dt} = A X + X B + F, \qquad \text{with $X \in \mathbf{R}^{N\times N}$},
\end{equation*}
where $A$ and $B$ are discretisations of an elliptic PDE operator.
This type of equation occurs in optimal control problems and in uncertainty
propagation algorithms for partial differential equations with random
parameters. Common to these applications is the large number of unknowns
even for problems with a reasonable mesh width.

Our multigrid solver is built on a recently developed algorithm for the
stationary Sylvester equation \cite{GH}
\begin{equation*}
A X + X B + F = 0.
\end{equation*}
We exploit the fact that the iterates can be well compressed when the
right hand side $F$ has a low-rank structure. If this compression is used
throughout the multigrid cycle, a significant reduction in time and
memory can be achieved for large scale problems.
This is accomplished by approximating the unknown $X$ by a low-rank matrix
\begin{equation*}
X \simeq UV^T, \qquad \text{with $U, V \in \mathbf{R}^{N\times k}$}.
\end{equation*}
For a certain precision, this low-rank multigrid typically requires
$\mathcal{O}(Nk^2) = \mathcal{O}(N\log^2(N))$ work whereas standard
multigrid would require $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. An adaptive strategy that
gradually enlarges the rank to get better precision is explored.
