Newton--Krylov methods are often implemented in ``matrix-free'' form, in
which the Jacobian-vector products required by the Krylov solver are
approximated by finite differences. We consider using approximate
function values in these finite differences. We first formulate a
finite-difference Arnoldi process that uses approximate function values
and give backward-error results for it. We then outline a Newton--Krylov
method that uses an implementation of the GMRES or Arnoldi method based
on this process and develop a local convergence analysis for it, giving
sufficient conditions on the approximate function values for desirable
local convergence properties to hold. We conclude with numerical
experiments involving particular function-value approximations suitable
for nonlinear diffusion problems. For this case, conditions are given for
meeting the convergence assumptions for both lagging and linearizing the
nonlinearity in the function evaluation.
