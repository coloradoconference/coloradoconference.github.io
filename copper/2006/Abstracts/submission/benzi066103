===ABSTRACT:
We describe an effective solver for the discrete Oseen problem
based on an augmented Lagrangian formulation of the corresponding
saddle point system. The proposed method is a block triangular
preconditioner used with a Krylov subspace iteration (BiCGStab).
The crucial ingredient is a novel multigrid approach for the (1,1)
block, which extends a technique introduced by Sch\"oberl for
elasticity problems to nonsymmetric problems. Our analysis indicates
that this approach results in fast convergence, independent of
the mesh size and largely insensitive to the viscosity.
We present experimental evidence for both isoP2-P0 and isoP2-P1
finite elements in support of our conclusions. We also show
results of a comparison with a state-of-the-art coupled multigrid
solver, showing the competitiveness of our approach.
