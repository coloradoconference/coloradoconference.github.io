In most scenarios, traditional multigrid methods fail to converge in the
case of the Helmhotz equation with relatively large wave numbers. One
approach for tackling this problem is to use a Krylov type algorithm both
as a smoother and as an outer iteration method in the multigrid cycles.
In this presentation, we extend this methodology to the iteration methods
based on the cascadic principle. Such algorithms are usually referred to
as one-way multigrid methods. We consider an adaptive control strategy
for the number of iterations on successive refinement levels and present
numerical results that illustrate the efficiency of the proposed
approach.
