Multiplicative preconditioners are popular for solving linear systems of
equations. We introduce additive preconditioners, which are more robust
and more readily available. By combining them with aggregation processes,
we obtain preconditioners that are nearly as effective as SVD-based
multiplicative preconditioners. Besides simplifying and stabilizing
the generation of such preconditioners, this technique also preserves
the structure of the input matrices, and we also employ it for numerical
computation of the sign of the matrix determinant. Our alternative
techniques employ additive preconditioners for computing null vectors
and null space bases for a singular matrix, and we extend this approach
to yield alternative linear solvers and to compute the tails of the SVDs
of ill conditioned matrices and matrix eigenvectors. We support our approach
with extensive analysis and numerical experiments.
