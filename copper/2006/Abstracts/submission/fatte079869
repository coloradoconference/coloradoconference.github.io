===ABSTRACT:
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a simplified quantum model that
has proved very successful in real applications. It introduces an
independent particles description of the electronic structure of
molecules or materials which is much simpler to treat that the
original Schroedinger equations.
Simulating realistic
physical systems by DFT however is still computationally very
demanding. More efficient numerical algorithms to reduce computer
time and enable larger simulations are always in demand by
chemists and physicists who are studying phenomenon at the
molecular level.

The finite element (FE) method, a very popular approach to solve
partial differential equations, has only recently started being
used for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of Density Functional
Theory for realistic 3D applications. Traditionally, the
pseudo-spectral approach has been the most popular in the field
under the denomination Plane Waves method. The regular usage of
periodic boundary conditions with simple geometries explains this
preference. However with the increase in computer power and the
growing interest in studying larger and more diverse systems,
more flexible real-space discretizations by finite difference or finite 
elements have recently attracted more interest. 

In this work we focus on FE discretizations with local mesh refinement 
for the Kohn-Sham equations, and propose an efficient iterative solver and 
preconditioner for this problem.
We present a hierarchical quadratic Finite Elements approach to discretize the
equations on structured non-uniform meshes. 
A multigrid FAC preconditioner is proposed to iteratively minimize the energy
functional associated to the Kohn-Sham equations.
It is based on an accelerated steepest descent-based scheme. 
The method has been implemented using SAMRAI, a parallel software 
infrastructure for general AMR applications.
Numerical results of electronic structure calculations on small atomic 
clusters show in particular a mesh-independent convergence rate for the iterative solver.
