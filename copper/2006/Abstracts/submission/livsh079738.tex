In this talk the AMG algorithm for solving the Scr\"{o}dinger eigenvalue
problem is discussed. Its goal is to approximate the eigenbasis, i.e.,
all eigenfunctions, of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator as it appears in the
Kohn-Sham equation.

The algorithm employs multilevel eigenvalues/eigenfunction
representations that allows approximation of most of the eigenfunctions
on the inexpensive coarse grids and leads to a reduction of both
computational and storage costs. In addition this structure is beneficial
for performance of a variety of applications essential to the Kohn-Sham
equations. Also addressed is the issue of quality of the obtained
sets of eigenfunctions, such as their accuracy and independence.
Numerical results and discussion of the further extension of the approach
will conclude the talk.
