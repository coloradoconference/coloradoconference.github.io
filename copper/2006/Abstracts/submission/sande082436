===ABSTRACT:
The performance of the adaptive smooth aggregation multigrid ($\alpha$SA) algorithm suffers for non-symmetric problems.   I will present a non-symmetric version of the algorithm that uses kaczmarz iteration as a relaxation step and smoothed aggregation of local right and left singular vectors to form a hierarchy of coarse grid operators.   Testing has been done on one and two dimensional convection dominated convection-diffusion.   I will present the current results and struggles of these tests.   Expect some whining.
