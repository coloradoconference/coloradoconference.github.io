A spatial multigrid algorithm for isotropic neutron transport is
presented in x-y geometry. The problem is discretized with discrete
ordinates in angle and corner balance finite differencing in space.
Spatial smoothing is accomplished by a four color block jacobi
relaxation, where the diagonal blocks correspond to four cell blocks on
the spatial grid. A bi-linear interpolation operator and its transpose
are used for the grid transfer operators. Encouraging preliminary results
are presented for homogeneous domains. Heterogeneous domains are also
discussed, especially the case of a vacuum region surrounded by a
diffusive region.
