===ABSTRACT:
\def\setC{\mathbb{C}}

Consider iteratively solving 
a linear system 
\begin{equation}\label{eku}
Ax=b, 
\end{equation} 
with invertible $A\in \setC^{n \times n}$  and $b\in \setC^n$,  
by splitting the matrix $A$ as 
\begin{equation}\label{toku}
A=L+R,
\end{equation} 
where $L$ and $R$ are both readily invertible. 
In such a case the recently introduced  residual minimizing 
Krylov subspace method \cite{HN} can be executed, allowing,
in a certain sense, preconditioning simultaneously with $L$ and $R$. 

Splitting satisfying \eqref{toku} result either form
the structure of the problem, or are algebraic. 
Splittings of Gauss-Seidel type belong to the latter category.
In this talk we discuss such splittings of $A$.
