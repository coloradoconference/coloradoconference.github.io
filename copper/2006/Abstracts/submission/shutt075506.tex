We consider a preconditioner derived from a block factorization of the
coefficient matrix that is generated in a Newton nonlinear iteration for
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This preconditioner is based
on the approximation of the Schur complement operator using a technique
proposed by Kay, Loghin, and
Wathen and Silvester, Elman, Kay, and Wathen. It is derived using
subsidiary computations (solutions of pressure Poisson and
convection--diffusion--like subproblems) that are significantly easier to
solve than the entire coupled system. We discuss a computational study
performed using MPSalsa, a stabilized finite element code, in which
parallel versions of these preconditioners are compared with a one-level
overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioner. Our results show
nearly ideal convergence rates for a wide range of Reynolds numbers on
two-dimensional problems with both enclosed and in/out flow boundary
conditions on both structured and unstructured meshes.
