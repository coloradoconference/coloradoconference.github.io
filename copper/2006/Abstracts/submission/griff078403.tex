Interior methods for constrained minimization simplify constraint
handling by removing the need to distinguish between active and inactive
constraints. This is possible because the resulting linear systems
naturally emphasize nearby constraints, dampening the effects of those
farther away. The price for this simplification is that the linear
systems are: (i) indefinite, (ii)
inevitably ill-conditioned, and (iii) have dimension determined by every
constraint in the problem. If the underlying problem is nonconvex, the
need to know the inertia of each linear system creates further
complications. We present a class of preconditioners that eliminate the
inevitable ill-conditioning and are asymptotically exact at vertex
solutions. Further benefits arise from the ability to drop inactive
constraints from the preconditioner without effecting the convergence of
the interior method. Inertia information is obtained by working with an
equivalent transformed linear system that is known to be positive
definite in the neighborhood of a minimizer.
