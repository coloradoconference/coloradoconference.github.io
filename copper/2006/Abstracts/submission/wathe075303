===ABSTRACT:
Saddle-point systems arise widely because they generally result 
from any problem with constraints. Hence in Fluid Mechanics 
incompressibility is a constraint on the Navier-Stokes equations, 
in Optimization algebraic and/or bound constraints are often 
applied and in PDE constrained optimization the PDEs themselves 
provide the constraints. 

This talk is about preconditioned iterative approaches to the 
solution of large-scale saddle-point problems based on 
preconditioners which preserve the constraints: so-called 
constraint preconditioners. We will briefly review the attractive 
feature of such preconditioners and then explain how these 
preconditioners can effectively be realized through a block 
factorization due to Wil Schilders. This reveals a range of 
possible approaches where the balance between faster convergence 
though better preconditioning and the cost of the preconditioner 
varies. 


This is joint work with Sue Dollar, Nick Gould and Wil Schilders
