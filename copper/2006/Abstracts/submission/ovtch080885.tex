In this presentation we discuss additive Schwarz methods for numerical
solutions of elliptic problems with periodic
boundary conditions. Unlike Dirichlet or Neumann type conditions that are
purely local, periodic conditions are
more global, therefore Schwarz type domain decomposition preconditioning
techniques do not perform in the same manner
as in Dirichlet or Neumann problems. In this work we study the parallel
performance of one- and two-level algorithms and report experimental
results obtained on the IBM BG/L. We also discuss some applications of
additive Schwarz preconditioners for the numerical simulation of
magnetohydrodynamics.
