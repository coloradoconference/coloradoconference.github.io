As a complement to popular multiplicative preconditioners, we introduce and
analyze additive preconditioners for matrix computations. We define structured
pseudo random additive preconditioners, which are almost as effective as the
SVD-based multiplicative preconditioners but are more robust and more readily
available. By using appropriate aggregation processes, we transform these
preconditioners into effective multiplicative preconditioners, which preserve
the structure of an input matrix. We apply our techniques to compute the solution
of a linear system of equations, the determinant, the rank and null vectors of
a matrix, a tail of its SVD, and its eigenvectors. Our analysis and extensive
experiments show the efficiency of our approach.
