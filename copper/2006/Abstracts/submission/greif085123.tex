We introduce a new preconditioning technique for iteratively solving
linear systems arising from finite element discretizations of the mixed
formulation of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The preconditioners
are block diagonal with positive definite blocks and are based on
discrete augmentation using the scalar Laplacian. They are motivated by
spectral equivalence properties of the discrete operators. Specifically,
we show that augmenting the curl-curl operator by a discrete grad-div
operator, weighed by the scalar Laplacian, yields almost immediate
convergence when preconditioned MINRES is used. We also show that if the
augmented term is replaced by the vector mass matrix we still obtain fast
convergence. Similar (operator-independent) algebraic principles can be
applied in general settings and give rise to preconditioners that work
effectively for saddle-point linear systems whose (1,1) block is highly
singular. Analytical observations and numerical results demonstrate the
scalability and the convergence properties of the proposed approach.
