We study multigrid for solving the stochastic steady-state diffusion
problem. We operate under the mild assumption that the diffusion
coefficient takes the form of a finite Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion. The
problem is discretized using a finite element methodology using the
polynomial chaos method to discretize the stochastic part of the problem.
We apply a multigrid algorithm to the stochastic problem in which the
spatial discretization is varied from grid to grid while the stochastic
discretization is held constant. We then show, theoretically and
experimentally, that the convergence rate is independent of the spatial
discretization, as in the deterministic case.
