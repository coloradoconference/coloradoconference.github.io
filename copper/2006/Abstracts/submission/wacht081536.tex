We present a hybrid framework for convex mixed-integer nonlinear
programming. In one extreme case, the method becomes the
branch-and-bound approach, where a nonlinear optimization problem is
solved in each node of the enumeration tree, and in the other extreme
it reduces to the polyhedral outer approximation algorithm, which
alternates between the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem
and a mixed-integer linear program.

Numerical results are presented, using an open source software
implementation available on http://www.coin-or.org.

This work results from an on-going research collaboration between IBM and CMU.
