In this talk we highlight recent attempts to solve systems of equations
arising from high-order spectral element discretizations. In particular, we
extend the success of Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioning on
structured grids to the unstructured case (using triangles).

We consider high-order nodal spectral elements based on the electrostatic
distribution. A low-order finite element preconditioner is utilized and
accelerated with Conjugate Gradient. The elements cause a particular
challenge as the local grids are also unstructured and suffer from poor
aspect ratios. We present numerical evidence in support of this method
and discuss the implications of using this approach.
