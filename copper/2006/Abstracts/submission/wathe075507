===ABSTRACT:
For PDE problems, Numerical Analysts would always wish to 
establish error estimates in `natural' norms for a given problem. 
In the context of iterative solution methods there is similarly 
the issue of the right norm for convergence: discrete norms are 
equivalent, but measuring a convergence tolerance in a norm in 
which half of the variables are scaled by $h^{-5}$ or $h^5$ is 
definitely not the right thing to do in general! 

In particular this issue arises when preconditioning with 
minimum residual methods because then monotonic residual reduction 
occurs in a norm based on the preconditioner. (For SPD problems 
and Conjugate Gradients it is well known that any SPD 
preconditioning does not affect the relevant norm). 

In this talk we will discuss this issue in the context of models 
of incompressible flow - Poisson, Stokes, Advection-Diffusion and 
Navier-Stokes problems - and show how the optimal block 
preconditioners developed by Silvester and the author for the 
Stokes problem give convergence in the right norm; comments will
also be made regarding Navier-Stokes preconditioning.


This is joint work with Howard Elman and David Silvester
