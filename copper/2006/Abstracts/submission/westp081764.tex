The equations describing viscoelastic fluid flow are inherently nonlinear
and pose a continuing challenge to most numerical approximation methods.
Even the addition of a small component of elastic behavior to Newtonian
fluid can introduce instabilities. In this talk we present progress
toward a multilevel least-squares finite element method for steady
viscoelastic fluid flow of Oldroyd-B type. Our approach is to combine an
outer iteration consisting of linearization steps on a nested sequence of
grids with an inner iteration of a least-squares finite element
discretization and algebraic multigrid linear solver. One of the
challenges arising from this system is in treating the convective nature
of the constitutive equation. We discuss an analogous, but simplified,
problem that illustrates the difficulties, and suggest a strategy for
least-squares discretizations to treat equations with strong convective
terms.
