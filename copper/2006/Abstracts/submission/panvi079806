===ABSTRACT:
As a complement to popular multiplicative preconditioners, we introduce and
analyze additive preconditioners for matrix computations. We define structured 
pseudo random additive preconditioners, which are almost as effective as the 
SVD-based multiplicative preconditioners but are more robust and more readily
available. By using appropriate aggregation processes, we transform these 
preconditioners into effective multiplicative preconditioners, which preserve 
the structure of an input matrix. We apply our techniques to compute the solution 
of a linear system of equations, the determinant, the rank and null vectors of 
a matrix, a tail of its SVD, and its eigenvectors. Our analysis and extensive 
experiments show the efficiency of our approach.
