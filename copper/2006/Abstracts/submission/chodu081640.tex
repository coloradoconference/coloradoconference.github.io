We consider the symmetric positive semi-definite problems arising from
generalized finite element discretizations on unstructured grids. The
focus will be on a simple two level approach, in which the coarse grid
problem corresponds to the space spanned by the partition of unity
functions. We characterize the kernel components of the stiffness matrix
for GFEM discretizations in two and three spatial dimensions. With this
characterization in hand, we can derive a stable decomposition of the
underlying GFEM space, using as an auxiliary coarse space the piece-wise
linear and continuous functions and prove a uniform convergence result
for the resulting two level method.
