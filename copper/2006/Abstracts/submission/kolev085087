===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we present a two-level preconditioning scheme for H(curl) bilinear forms. The scheme utilizes an auxiliary problem on a related mesh that is more amenable for constructing optimal order multigrid methods. Combined with a domain embedding (or ``fictitious'' domain) technique our method can precondition a problem defined on a very complicated mesh by a standard geometric multigrid on a box.
