===ABSTRACT:
Extending Newton's method to solving $F(x)=0,$ where
$F:\mathbf{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbf{R}^n$ is continuously differentiable
and $m>n$, requires solving an underdetermined linear system
for the Newton step at each iteration.  When the step is the 
pseudo-inverse solution, the resulting method is sometimes 
called the normal flow method.  Like Newton's method, it 
usually is easy to implement, has a simple and useful local
convergence theory and, in its pure form, is not well suited
for solving large-scale problems.  
In this talk I will present variations of the normal flow method
analogous to inexact Newton methods and globalized inexact
Newton methods.  These methods have been developed to improve the 
robustness and efficiency of the normal flow method on large-scale
problems.  Preliminary computational results on some simple 
problems will be presented.  This work was done in collaboration with my advisor Homer Walker at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
