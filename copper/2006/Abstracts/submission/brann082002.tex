Algebraic multigrid (AMG) has been shown to be an efficient iterative
solver for many of the large and sparse linear systems arising from the
discretization of partial differential equations. There remain, however,
many classes of problems for which conventional AMG setup algorithms,
based on the properties of
M-matrices, are inappropriate. In this talk, we consider the use of
compatible relaxation (CR) as a tool for extending the applicability of
AMG. A CR-based coarsening algorithm is presented along with numerical
results demonstrating that the variational multigrid solver resulting
from the proposed approach maintains multigrid-like optimality, without
the need for parameter tuning, for some problems where current algorithms
exhibit degraded performance.
