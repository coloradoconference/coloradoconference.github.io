===ABSTRACT:

I shall introduce a new formulation for the Stokes problem, stemming 
from the consistent splitting scheme for the time-dependent
Navier-Stokes equations introduced by Guermond & Shen (JCP, 2003).
I shall present ample numerical results, using spectral and finite element
methods, to show that the new formulation leads to positive definite
systems and does not require the usual inf-sup condition between the
discrete spaces for the velocity and pressure.
