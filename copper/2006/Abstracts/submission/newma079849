===ABSTRACT:
We discuss a high
order projection scheme for time integration of the
incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. 
The method is based on a
projection onto
a divergence-free subspace interleaved with a
Krylov based exponential time
integration.
This semi-explicit approach 
provides stability and high order
accuracy without the need for a nonlinear iteration.
We present numerical examples to support our claims
and provide
comparison against a Crank Nicolson scheme.
