An approach is presented to construct the interpolation operators of
algebraic multigrid (AMG) based on solving a series of local optimization
problems. Given a set of coarse nodes, the approach first attempts to
maximize the support of these nodes without introducing additional
nonzeros in the stiffness matrix of the next coarser level. By doing so,
it is possible to reduce the energy of coarse interpolations without
increasing operator complexity. The local optimization problems are
formulated in such a way that the problem null space can be represented
exactly at each multigrid level. In addition, a condition ensuring
nonsingularity of a local matrix highlights the need for special
considerations when the null space dimension exceeds the number of
unknowns for each node. Numerical examples for the Poisson equation and
linear elasticity demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and the
optimal performance of an ensuing AMG preconditioner. Connections with
element-free AMGe are also described.
