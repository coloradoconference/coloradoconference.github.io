===ABSTRACT:
We will discuss an asynchronous parallel implementation of a
derivative-free augmented Lagrangian algorithm for handling general
nonlinear constraints recently proposed by Kolda, Lewis, and Torczon.  The method solves a series of linearly constrained subproblems, seeking to approximately minimize the augmented Lagrangian which involves the nonlinear constraints.  Each subproblem is solved using a generating set search algorithm capable of handling degenerate linear constraints.  We use APPSPACK to solve the linearly-constrained subproblems, enabling the objective and nonlinear constraint functions to be computed asynchronously in parallel.  A description and theoretical analysis of the algorithm will be given followed by numerical results.
