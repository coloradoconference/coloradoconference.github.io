===ABSTRACT:
In this talk we consider the iterative solution of a nonlinear
system arising from a finite element discretisation of the fourth
order equation
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (|u|^{\gamma}\nabla\Delta u) =
0, \] where $\gamma>0$.  This equation models a thin liquid film
spreading on a solid surface, with $u$ the height of the film. It is
well known that for nonnegative initial data, the solution $u$
remains nonnegative for all time.  However, this nonnegativity of
$u$ is not guaranteed if the equation is discretised in a naive way.
Imposing the nonnegativity of $u$ as a constraint leads to a
discrete variational inequality to be solved at each time step.
Specifically defining $S^h$ to be the space of piecewise linear
functions on a uniform mesh and $K^h\subset S^h$ to be the space of
nonnegative functions in $S^h$, given $U^{n-1}\in K^h$ we seek
$U^{n} \in K^h$ and $W^n \in S^h$ such that
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &(U^{n},\chi)^h + \tau\,(|U^{n-1}|^{\gamma}\nabla W^n,\nabla \chi) = (U^{n-1},\chi)^h
\qquad \forall \ \chi \in S^h,&  \\
  &(\nabla U^{n},\nabla (\chi-U^{n})) \geq (W^{n},
  \chi-U^n)^h \qquad \forall \ \chi \in K^h,&
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\tau$ represents the time step, and $(\cdot,\cdot)$ and
$(\cdot,\cdot)^h$ represent the $L^2$ inner product and its
trapezoidal rule discretisation respectively.

Well-posedness, stability, unique solvability, and convergence of
$U^n$ to $u$ and $W^n$ to $w=-\Delta u$ were established by Barrett,
Blowey and Garcke in 1998.  To solve the nonlinear system they used
an Uzawa algorithm, for which they were able to demonstrate
convergence of $U^{n,p}\rightarrow U^n$ and of $\int_{\Omega}
|U^{n-1}|^{\gamma} |\nabla(W^n-W^{n,p})|^2 dx \rightarrow 0$, as the
number of iterations $p\rightarrow\infty$.  However, the convergence
of this algorithm was found to be extremely slow.  Here, we propose
instead a coupled Gauss-Seidel algorithm in multigrid mode for the
iterative solution of the nonlinear system.  Proving convergence for
the multigrid algorithm remains an open question, but numerical
results indicate mesh independent convergence to the same solution
as that achieved with the Uzawa algorithm in most cases tested, with
a greatly reduced computational cost compared to iterating on a
single grid.
