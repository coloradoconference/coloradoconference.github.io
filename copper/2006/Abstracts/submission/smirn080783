===ABSTRACT:
We consider a generalized Gauss-Newton's scheme
$$
x_{n+1}=\xi-\theta(F^{\prime*}(x_n)F'(x_n),\alpha_n)F^{\prime*}(x_n)\{F(x_n)-f-F'(x_n)(x_n-\xi)\}
$$
for solving nonlinear unstable operator equation $\,F(x)=f\,$ in a
Hilbert space. In case of noisy data we propose a novel a
posteriori stopping rule
$$
||F(x_N)-f_\delta||^2\le \tau \delta <||F(x_n)-f_\delta||^2,\q 0\le n< N,\q
\tau >1,
$$
and prove a convergence theorem under a source type condition on the
solution. As a consequence of this theorem  we obtain  convergence
rates for five different generating functions, $\,\theta=\theta(\lambda,\alpha),\,$
of a spectral parameter $\lambda$ and $\alpha>0$.

The new algorithms are tested on the 2D inverse gravimetry problem
reduced to a nonlinear integral equation of the first kind:
$$
F(x):=g \,\triangle \sigma
\int^b_a\int^d_c\left\{\frac{1}{[\,(\xi-t)^2+(\nu-s)^2+x^2(\xi,\nu)\,]^{1/2}}\right.
$$
$$
\left.-
\frac{1}{[\,(\xi-t)^2+(\nu-s)^2+h^2\,]^{1/2}}\right\}\,d\xi\,d\nu =
f(t,s),
$$
where $g$ is the gravitational constant, $\triangle \sigma$ is the
density jump on the interface, and $f(t,s)$ is the gravitational
strength anomaly. The
results of numerical simulations are presented and some practical
recommendations on the choice of parameters are given.
