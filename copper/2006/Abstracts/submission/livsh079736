===ABSTRACT:
In this talk  the AMG algorithms for solving the Scr\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problem is discussed. Its goal is  to approximate  the eigenbasis (all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) for the Schr\"{o}dinger operator  as it appears in the Kohn-Sham equation.
 
The algorithm employs  multilevel eigenvalues/eigenfunction representations that allows approximation of most of the eigenfunctions on the inexpensive coarse grids, and that leads to reduction of  both computational and storage costs. In addition this structure is beneficial for performance of a variety  of applications essential to the Kohn-Sham equations.  Also  addressed is the issue of  quality of the obtained
sets of eigenfunctions, such as  their accuracy and  independence. Numerical results and discussion of the further extension of the approach will conclude the talk.
