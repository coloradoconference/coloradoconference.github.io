===ABSTRACT:
We give an overview of the IFISS ({\em Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software}) Package, a graphical Matlab package for the interactive numerical study of incompressible flow problems. It includes algorithms for discretization by mixed finite element methods and a posteriori error estimation of the computed solutions. The package can also be used as a computational laboratory for experimenting with state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the discrete linear equation systems that
arise in the modelling of incompressible flow.  A unique feature of the package is its comprehensive nature; for each problem addressed, it enables the study of both discretization and iterative solution algorithms as well as the interaction between the two and the resulting effect on overall efficiency.
