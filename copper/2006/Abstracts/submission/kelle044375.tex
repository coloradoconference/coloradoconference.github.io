In this paper we propose and analyze a scalable preconditioner for
the Wigner-Poisson equations for a resonant tunneling diode (RTD), and
apply that preconditioner to a matrix-free continuation study of the
dependence of the current through the device on the applied voltage.

The equations are a integro-partial differential equation for the
distribution of the electrons in the device couples with Poisson's
equation for the electrostatic potential. Our preconditioner is the
inverse of the kinetic energy operator. We prove that, after elimination
of the Poisson equation, the equation after left preconditioning is a
compact fixed point problem for the Wigner distribution. We then apply
that compactness to show mathematical scalibility of the inner Krylov
iteration, and use that to show scalability of the continuation. We
present numerical results that support the theory.
