Additive Schwarz preconditioners, when a coarse grid correction is
added, are said to be optimal for certain discretized PDE problems,
in the sense that bounds on the convergence of iterative methods
are independent on the mesh size. Cai and Zou [$\tilt Numer.$
$\tilt Linear$ $\tilt Algebra$ $\tilt Appl.$, 9:379--397, 2002]
showed with an example that in the absence of a coarse grid
correction the usual GMRES bound has a factor of the order of
$1/\sqrt h$. In this paper we consider the same one-dimensional
example (as well as a two-dimensional counterpart) and show that
the behavior of the method is not well represented by the above
mentioned bound. We use a different bound for GMRES from [Simoncini
and Szyld, $\tilt SIAM$ $\tilt Rev.$, 47:247--272, 2005] and show
that the relevant factor is bounded by $c-O(h)$, so that as h\rightarrow
0$, it approximates a constant. Furthermore, for a
sequence of meshes the convergence curves are almost identical and the
number of GMRES iterations needed for convergence has a very slow growth.
