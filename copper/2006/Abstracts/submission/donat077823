===ABSTRACT:
We consider the de-blurring problem of noisy and blurred images in
the case of space invariant point spread functions. The use of
appropriate boundary conditions leads to linear systems with
structured coefficient matrices related to space invariant
operators like Toeplitz, circulants, trigonometric matrix algebras
etc. We combine an algebraic multigrid (which is designed ad hoc
for structured matrices) with the low-pass projectors typical of
the classical geometrical multigrid employed in a PDEs context.
Thus, using an appropriate smoother, we obtain an iterative
regularizing method (see \cite{mgmreg, Dphd}) based on: projection
in a subspace where it is easier to distinguish between the signal
and the noise and then application of an iterative regularizing
method in the projected subspace. Therefore any iterative
regularizing method like conjugate gradient (CG), conjugate
gradient for normal equation (CGNE), Landweber etc., can be used
as smoother in our multigrid algorithm. The projector is chosen in
order to maintain the same algebraic structure at each recursion
level and having a low-pass filter property, which is very useful
in order to reduce the noise effects. In this way, we obtain a
better restored image with a flatter restoration error curve and
also in less time than the auxiliary method used as smoother. As
direct consequence the choice of the exact iteration where to stop
is less critical than in other regularizing iterative methods.
Furthermore, we can choose multigrid procedures which are
extremely more efficient than classical techniques without losing
accuracy in the restored image. Several numerical experiments show
the effectiveness of our proposal.

A Theoretical analysis of multigrid methods is usually a difficult
task and a first largely used approach considers a two grid
method. In the same way, to proving the regularizing properties of
our multigrid methods, we provide some estimations on the filter
factor of the two level strategy.

Finally, it can be easily (by using a simple projection at every
step) combined with nonnegativity constraints. Moreover we propose
a possible generalization where the multigrid regularization is
applied as a one-step method: now the only parameter to choose is
the number of recursive calls.
