===ABSTRACT:
Newton--Krylov methods are often implemented in ``matrix-free'' form, in which the Jacobian-vector products required by the Krylov solver are approximated by finite differences. We consider using approximate function values in these finite differences. We first formulate a finite-difference Arnoldi process that uses approximate function values and give backward-error results for it. We then outline a Newton--Krylov method that uses an implementation of the GMRES or Arnoldi method based on this process and develop a local convergence analysis for it, giving sufficient conditions on the approximate function values for desirable local convergence properties to hold. We conclude with numerical experiments involving particular function-value approximations suitable for nonlinear diffusion problems.  For this case, conditions are given for meeting the convergence assumptions for both lagging and linearizing the nonlinearity in the function evaluation.
