===ABSTRACT:
A spatial multigrid algorithm for isotropic neutron transport is 
presented in x-y geometry.  The problem is discretized with discrete ordinates in angle and corner balance finite differencing in space.  Spatial smoothing is accomplished by a four color block jacobi relaxation, where the diagonal blocks correspond to four cell blocks on the spatial grid.  A bi-linear interpolation operator and its transpose are used for the grid transfer operators.  Encouraging preliminary results are presented for homogeneous domains.  Heterogeneous domains are also discussed, especially the case of a vacuum region surrounded by a diffusive region.
