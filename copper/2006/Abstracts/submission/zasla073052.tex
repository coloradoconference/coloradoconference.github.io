The electromagnetic prospecting problem requires fine gridding to account
for sea bottom and to model complicated targets. This results in large
computational costs using conventional finite-difference solvers. To
circumvent these problems, we employ a volume integral equation approach
for preconditioning and to eliminate the background, thus significantly
reducing the condition number and dimensionality of the problem. Since
the problem should be solved in unbounded domain we use so-called optimal
grids to truncate error of approximation at infinity. Special averaging
procedure is proposed to account for inhomogenuity. Theory and numerical
results will be presented.
