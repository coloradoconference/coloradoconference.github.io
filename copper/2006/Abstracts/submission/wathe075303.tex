Saddle-point systems arise widely because they generally result
from any problem with constraints. Hence in Fluid Mechanics
incompressibility is a constraint on the Navier-Stokes equations,
in Optimization algebraic and/or bound constraints are often
applied and in PDE constrained optimization the PDEs themselves
provide the constraints.

This talk is about preconditioned iterative approaches to the
solution of large-scale saddle-point problems based on
preconditioners which preserve the constraints: so-called
constraint preconditioners. We will briefly review the attractive
feature of such preconditioners and then explain how these
preconditioners can effectively be realized through a block
factorization due to Wil Schilders. This reveals a range of
possible approaches where the balance between faster convergence
though better preconditioning and the cost of the preconditioner
varies.


This is joint work with Sue Dollar, Nick Gould and Wil Schilders
