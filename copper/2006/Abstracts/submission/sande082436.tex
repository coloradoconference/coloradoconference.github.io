The performance of the adaptive smooth aggregation multigrid ($\alpha$SA)
algorithm suffers for non-symmetric problems. I will present a
non-symmetric version of the algorithm that uses kaczmarz iteration as a
relaxation step and smoothed aggregation of local right and left singular
vectors to form a hierarchy of coarse grid operators. Testing has been
done on one and two dimensional convection dominated
convection-diffusion. I will present the current results and struggles of
these tests. Expect some whining.
