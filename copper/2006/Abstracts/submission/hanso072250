===ABSTRACT:
We develop and compare multilevel algorithms for solving  bound
constrained nonlinear variational problems via interior point
methods. Several equivalent formulations of the linear systems
arising at each iteration of the interior point method are compared
from the point of view of conditioning and iterative solution.
Furthermore, we show how a multilevel continuation strategy can be
used to obtain good initial guesses (\lq\lq hot starts\rq\rq) for
each nonlinear iteration. A minimal surface problem is used to
illustrate the various approaches.  (Joint work with Michele Benzi
