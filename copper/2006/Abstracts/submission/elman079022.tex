We give an overview of the IFISS ({\em Incompressible Flow Iterative
Solution Software}) Package, a graphical Matlab package for the
interactive numerical study of incompressible flow problems. It includes
algorithms for discretization by mixed finite element methods and a
posteriori error estimation of the computed solutions. The package can
also be used as a computational laboratory for experimenting with
state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the discrete linear
equation systems that
arise in the modelling of incompressible flow. A unique feature of the
package is its comprehensive nature; for each problem addressed, it
enables the study of both discretization and iterative solution
algorithms as well as the interaction between the two and the resulting
effect on overall efficiency.
