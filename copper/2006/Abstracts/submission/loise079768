===ABSTRACT:
In Schwarz-like domain decomposition methods, a domain $\Omega$ is
broken into two or more subdomains and Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin or
pseudo-differential problems are iteratively solved on each subdomain.
For certain problems, it is well-known that the Dirichlet-Neumann
iteration for two subdomains will converge in two steps. Let $\Omega$
be an open domain and $\Omega_{1},\Omega_{2},\Omega_{3}$ a domain
decomposition of $\Omega$ such that each pair of subdomains shares
an interface (for instance, $\Omega=\{ z\in\Bbb C|\;|z|<1\}$ and
$\Omega_{j}=\{ re^{i\theta}|\;0<r<1\textrm{ and }\theta\in(2j\pi/3,2(j+1)\pi/3)\}$,
$j=1,2,3$.) We will show a new Schwarz-like domain decomposition
method that converges in two iterations in this situation.
