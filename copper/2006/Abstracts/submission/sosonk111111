\section*{Abstract}

The paper examines various parallel iterative solvers for the new Flexible
Local Approximation MEthod (FLAME) \cite{Tsukerman05, Tsukerman06}
applied to colloidal systems. The electrostatic potential in such  systems
can be described, at least for monovalent salts in the solvent, by the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation (see e.g. \cite{Grosberg02}). Classical
Finite-Difference (FD) schemes would require unreasonably fine meshes to
represent the boundaries of multiple spherical particles at arbitrary
locations with sufficient accuracy. In the Finite Element Method, mesh
generation for a large number of particles becomes impractical. The Fast
Multipole Method works well only if the particle sizes are neglected and 
the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is linearized \cite{Greengard02}.

Classical FD schemes rely on Taylor expansions that break down near 
material interfaces (such as particle boundaries) due to the lack of 
smoothness  of the field. In FLAME, Taylor expansions in the vicinity 
of the particles  are
replaced with much more accurate approximations. Namely, the local FLAME
bases are constructed by matching (via the boundary conditions) the
spherical harmonics for the electrostatic potential inside and outside 
the particle; see \cite{Tsukerman05, Tsukerman06} for details.

The system matrices of FLAME and classical FD have the same sparsity
structure for the same grid stencil on a regular Cartesian grid; for
example, the standard seven-point stencil leads to a seven-diagonal
matrix.  However, the FLAME matrix is generally nonsymmetric.
Several parallel iterative solution techniques have been tested with an
emphasis on suitable parallel preconditioning for the nonsymmetric 
system matrix. In particular, flexible GMRES \cite{saad03iterative}
preconditioned with the distributed Schur Complement
\cite{saad-sosonkina-pschur} has been considered and compared with
Additive Schwarz and global incomplete ILU(0) preconditionings.
It has been observed that Schur Complement preconditioning with a small 
amount of fill and a few inner iterations scales well and exhibits good 
solution times while attaining
almost linear speedup. The number of iterations and the computational time
depends only mildly on the Debye parameter of the electrolyte.
