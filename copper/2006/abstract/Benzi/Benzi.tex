We describe an effective solver for the discrete Oseen
problem based on an augmented Lagrangian formulation of the
corresponding saddle point system. The proposed method is a
block triangular preconditioner used with a Krylov subspace
iteration (BiCGStab). The crucial ingredient is a novel
multigrid approach for the (1,1) block, which extends a
technique introduced by Sch\"oberl for elasticity problems
to nonsymmetric problems. Our analysis indicates that this
approach results in fast convergence, independent of the
mesh size and largely insensitive to the viscosity. We
present experimental evidence for both isoP2-P0 and isoP2-P1
finite elements in support of our conclusions. We also show
results of a comparison with a state-of-the-art coupled
multigrid solver, showing the competitiveness of our
approach.
