When using computational models to design devices or systems,
appropriate modeling of uncertainties is crucial to ensure robust and
reliable designs.  This talk offers a survey of uncertainty
quantification and reliability analysis techniques and demonstrates
how they can be tightly integrated with optimization algorithms to
determine designs that meet reliability and robustness constraints in
addition to optimality criteria.  Such optimization under uncertainty
(OUU) capabilities, developed and implemented in Sandia National
Laboratories' DAKOTA toolkit, will be surveyed.  Novel problem
formulations for reliability-based design optimization in realistic
physical applications will be presented and examples of how advanced
reliability methods can provide more accurate estimates of output
uncertainty given.
