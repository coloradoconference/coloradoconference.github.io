A spatial multigrid algorithm for isotropic neutron
transport is presented in $x$-$y$ geometry. The problem is
discretized with discrete ordinates in angle and corner
balance finite differencing in space. Spatial smoothing is
accomplished by a four color block Jacobi relaxation, where
the diagonal blocks correspond to four cell blocks on the
spatial grid. A bilinear interpolation operator and its
transpose are used for the grid transfer operators.
Encouraging preliminary results are presented for
homogeneous domains. Heterogeneous domains are also
discussed, especially the case of a vacuum region surrounded
by a diffusive region.
