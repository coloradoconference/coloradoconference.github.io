One year has passed and Blue Gene has been placed at several
sites, many of which have a computational science component
that involves iterative methods. In this talk, I will review
some of the results obtained at some of these sites. I will
elaborate on work underway with collaborators and colleagues
in the area of computational science. For those unfamiliar
with the Blue Gene System, I will very briefly describe the
hardware and software environment.
<P>
I will describe how
Blue Gene might be used to tackle multi-scale problems, many
of which will need good parallel iterative solvers. While
progress is being made, there remain many challenges for the
computational science community to apply the Blue Gene
resource to Big science problems with impact on society that
until now or in current implementations have fallen short of
the mark. Finally, I will elaborate on opportunities that
exist for the community to get access to Blue Gene.
