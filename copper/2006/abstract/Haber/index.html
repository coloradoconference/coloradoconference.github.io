In this work we develop an octree discretization for
Maxwells equations in the quasi-static regime.  We then use
this discretization in order to develop a multigrid method
for Maxwells equations with highly discontinuous
coefficients.  We show that our approach can be interpreted
as a semi-algebraic multigrid method with physical base for
coarse grid selection.  We test our algorithms and compare
it to other multilevel algorithms.
