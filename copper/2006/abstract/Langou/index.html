The year 2005 have been marked by two new papers on the
Classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm (see [1,2]). These results
offer a better understanding of the Classical Gram-Schmidt
algorithm. It is finally proved that the Classical
Gram-Schmidt algorithm generates a loss of orthogonality
bounded by the square of the condition number of the initial
matrix. In the first part of the talk, I will quickly review
the proof, explain its key points and its implication in the
context of iterative methods. In the second part, I will
focus on the new results that we have found related to the
Classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm. In particular an
a-posteriori reorthogonalization scheme extremely efficient
is given in the context of iterative methods. (We borrow
ideas developed in [3] in the context of GMRES-MGS.)
