An approach is presented to construct the interpolation
operators of algebraic multigrid (AMG) based on solving a
series of local optimization problems. Given a set of coarse
nodes, the approach first attempts to maximize the support
of these nodes without introducing additional nonzeros in
the stiffness matrix of the next coarser level. By doing so,
it is possible to reduce the energy of coarse interpolations
without increasing operator complexity.
<P>
The local
optimization problems are formulated in such a way that the
problem null space can be represented exactly at each
multigrid level. In addition, a condition ensuring
nonsingularity of a local matrix highlights the need for
special considerations when the null space dimension exceeds
the number of unknowns for each node. Numerical examples for
the Poisson equation and linear elasticity demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach and the optimal performance of
an ensuing AMG preconditioner. Connections with element-free
AMGe are also described.
