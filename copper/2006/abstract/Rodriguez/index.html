<p>
It is a well known fact that under primary fluid production
conditions, pore pressures of hydrocarbon reservoirs and
aquifers tend to decline. This decline may lead to severe
deformations inside and around the reservoir. The
deformation observed at the surface is known as subsidence
and can produce negative environmental effects as well as
damage to surface facilities and infrastructures. Positively
speaking, subsidence observations can be combined with
inverse algorithms in order to assess reservoir behavior and
detect non-depleted regions that may be subject to further
exploitation. The estimation of subsidence usually requires
the performance of flow simulations coupled to mechanical
deformation. These simulations are computationally intensive
and, for this reason, they are seldom performed.
<P>
In this
work we introduce a Krylov-secant inversion framework for
estimating the deformation produced as a consequence of pore
pressure reduction in the reservoir. The formulation is
based on a solution of the equilibrium equation where
perturbations due to pore pressure reduction and elastic
modulus contrasts are introduced. The resulting equation for
the strain is given in the form of the
Lippmann-Schwinger integral, i.e.,

The minimization problem (2) is large
and ill-posed, especially in the event of high
heterogeneities and few measurements. To perform the
inversion, a Newton-Krylov procedure based on
Krylov-secant updates is proposed.
<P>
The Krylov-secant framework entails
a recycling or extrapolation of the Krylov information
generated for the solution of the current Jacobian equation
to perform a sequence of secant steps restricted to the
Krylov basis. In other words, the Newton step is recursively
composed with Broyden updates constrained to the reduced
Krylov subspace. This is repeated until no further decrease
of the nonlinear residual can be delivered, in which case a
new nonlinear step yielding another Jacobian system is
performed.
<P>
The proposed framework includes dynamic
control of linear tolerances (i.e., forcing terms),
preconditioning, and regularization to achieve both
efficiency and robustness. Furthermore, this approach may
optionally accommodate the latest deflation or augmented
Krylov basis strategies for further efficiency. The
framework has been previously applied for the solution of
several nonlinear PDEs under Newton-Krylov implementations,
but the present work explores further issues with respect to
inexact Gauss-Newton methods based on Krylov iterative
solutions such as LSQR.
<P>
Numerical experiments indicate
that the current approach is a viable option for performing
fast inversion implementations. Comparisons are made against
traditional quasi-Newton and gradient-based implementations.
It is concluded that the proposed approach has the potential
for application to electromagnetic, radar, seismic and
medical technologies.
