The original TPABLO algorithms are a collection of algorithms
which compute a symmetric permutation of a linear system such
that the permuted system has a relatively full block
diagonal with relatively large nonzero entries. This block
diagonal can then be used as a preconditioner.
We propose and analyze three extensions of this approach: we
incorporate a nonsymmetric
permutation to obtain a large diagonal, we use a more general
parametrization for TPABLO, and we
use a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner which can be implemented
to have the same execution time
as the corresponding block Jacobi preconditioner. Since our
approach allows for efficient use of level 3
BLAS operations, it outperforms direct solvers and rivals
standard ILU preconditioners on many test
problems on a single processor system, while having good
potential for efficient parallelization.
