In this presentation we discuss additive Schwarz methods for
numerical solutions of elliptic problems with periodic
boundary conditions. Unlike Dirichlet or Neumann type
conditions that are purely local, periodic conditions are
more global, therefore Schwarz type domain decomposition
preconditioning techniques do not perform in the same manner
as in Dirichlet or Neumann problems. In this work we study
the parallel performance of one- and two-level algorithms
and report experimental results obtained on the IBM BG/L.
We also discuss some applications of additive Schwarz
preconditioners for the numerical simulation of
magnetohydrodynamics.
