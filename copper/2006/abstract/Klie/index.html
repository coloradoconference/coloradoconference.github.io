In contrast to the widespread use of Monte Carlo simulations
(MCS), stochastic equations have shown remarkable potential
to develop efficient, accurate and physical insightful
models. The main challenge of solving stochastic equations
is to develop tractable descriptions of the system response
in terms of stochastic differential operators and random
fields. In particular, the solution of stochastic PDEs in
porous media flow raises unexplored challenges to the
solution of the discretized system of equations due to the
significant size of standard reservoir problems combined
with the uncertainty induced by error measurements,
discontinuities, nonlinearities in the reservoir parameters
at different spatial and temporal scales.
<P>
This work
introduces a Krylov-Karhunen-Loeve moment equation (KKLME)
approach for the solution of stochastic PDEs arising in
large-scale porous media flow applications. The approach
combines recent developments in Karhunen-Loeve moment
equation methods with a block deflated Krylov iterative
solution of a sequence of deterministic linear algebraic
equations sharing the same matrix operator but different
right-hand sides (RHSs).
<P>
In this approach, the log of the
random field (i.e., log of permeability) describing the
transmissibility coefficients is decomposed as the sum of a
deterministic average log field plus a mean-zero random
fluctuation. The covariance function associated with the
fluctuation component is further decomposed by means of the
Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion scheme. This expansion
consists of modes (i.e. stochastic orders) of increasing
frequency but decreasing magnitude. It has been shown that
the KL expansion is of mean square convergence and summation
thus implying significant computational savings.
Subsequently, a mixed finite element procedure (equivalent
to a cell-centered finite difference scheme under a suitable
quadrature rule) is employed to derive a system of linear
random algebraic equations.
<P>
In order to compute
higher-order approximations for the different pressure
moments, a perturbation approach followed by an expansion of
orthogonal random variables is performed to express the
variability of pressures with respect to the random field.
The algebraic manipulation of modes and moments results in a
sequence of deterministic linear systems with multiple RHSs
sharing the same matrix operator. This matrix operator
corresponds to the discretization of the average random
field that, in general, has better algebraic properties than
the operator associated with the original random field. A
set of independent RHSs becomes available when a lower
moment is computed, and each moment involves the solution of
several modes or combinations of them with previous moment
solutions. Since the associated average system is generally
large and sparse, a Krylov subspace iterative solver is
suitable in this case. The availability of RHSs describes a
particular computational pattern that is amenable for highly
scalable implementations and, at the same time, imposes
particular challenges for an efficient Krylov subspace
implementation.
<P>
With regard to the solution of systems
with multiple RHSs, significant advances have been made in
recycling the information generated by Krylov iterative
methods. Deflation methods have been shown to be very
effective in these circumstances as they ``remove''
components of the solution associated with extreme
eigenvalues that prevent or slow down convergence. To
perform deflation the Krylov subspace is selectively
augmented with approximate eigenvectors that are either
computed during the iteration or somehow known <I>a
priori</I> from some geometrical/physical mean.
<P>
On the other
hand, in order to reduce the negative effects of sequential
inner products on memory performance, it is advisable to
rely on block implementations or, in other words, process a
subset of right-hand-sides in a simultaneous fashion. A
novel block deflation Krylov iterative method is proposed.
The main feature of this implementation is to enable changes
both in the size of the block and in the augmented subspace
as the iteration proceeds. This ensures both numerical
stability and flexibility in replacing deflated RHSs
(i.e., associated with converging solutions)
with new RHSs.
<P>
Numerical experiments show that the KKLME approach requires
significant less computing time than MCS to converge to the
different statistical moments for the pressure response.
Results are shown for single phase flow and for pressure
system arising in two-phase fully implicit formulations
using a block deflation CG iterative method. In light of
these preliminary results, extensions to relate random
fields with spectrum information are required in order to
exploit further efficiencies.
