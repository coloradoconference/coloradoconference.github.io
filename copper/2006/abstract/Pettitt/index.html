<p>
A quantitative theory of the structure of molecular fluids
described by atoms or sites has remained elusive in soft
condensed matter theory. Many-body and field theoretic
approaches to the correlations liquids have advanced slowly
since the 1930s. The qualitative and quantitative
inconsistencies of the many-body integral equation theory
for predicting the structure and thermodynamic properties of
model molecular fluids have been understood for some time.
<P>
Several means have been proposed to correct these
inconsistencies, many concentrating on the Goldstone
theorem. A formally distinct method for constructing a
diagrammatically proper theory eliminates terms in the
expansion which correspond to unphysical intramolecular
interactions, or so-called bad graphs. Unfortunately, while
certain qualitative advances using the proper theory have
been successful the quantitative results appear to be
uniformly disappointing in comparison to simulation.
<P>
We present a new derivation from a topological expansion of
a model for the single atom activity followed by a
topological reduction and low order truncation. This leads
to an approximate numerical value for the new density
coefficient.  The resulting equations give a substantial
improvement over the standard construction as shown with
a series of simple diatomic model simulations.
