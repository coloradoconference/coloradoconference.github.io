We show that the conjugate gradient method with variable
preconditioning in certain situations cannot give any
improvement compared to the steepest descent method for
solving a linear system with a symmetric positive definite
(SPD) matrix of coefficients. We assume that the
preconditioner is SPD on each step, and that the condition
number of the preconditioned system matrix is bounded from
above by a constant independent of the step number. Our
proof is geometric and is based on the simple fact that a
nonzero vector multiplied by all SPD matrices with a
condition number bounded by a constant generates a circular
cone.
