Newton-Krylov methods are often implemented in
``matrix-free'' form, in which the Jacobian-vector products
required by the Krylov solver are approximated by finite
differences. We consider using approximate function values
in these finite differences. We first formulate a
finite-difference Arnoldi process that uses approximate
function values and give backward-error results for it. We
then outline a Newton-Krylov method that uses an
implementation of the GMRES or Arnoldi method based on this
process and develop a local convergence analysis for it,
giving sufficient conditions on the approximate function
values for desirable local convergence properties to hold.
We conclude with numerical experiments involving particular
function-value approximations suitable for nonlinear
diffusion problems. For this case, conditions are given for
meeting the convergence assumptions for both lagging and
linearizing the nonlinearity in the function evaluation.
