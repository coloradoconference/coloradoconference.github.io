The limited-memory BFGS method has been widely used in large
scale unconstrained optimization problems, including protein
structure prediction. A major weakness of the L-BFGS method
is that it may converge very slowly for ill-conditioned
problems. We propose a preconditioned L-BFGS method, where
we form the preconditioner from parts of the partially
separable objective function.
<P>
We report results of
experiments in the context of the protein structure
prediction problem for four different proteins, using a
protein energy model as the objective function and multiple
initial configurations for each protein. The results show
speed-ups with factors between 3 and 10 in terms of function
evaluations and with factors between 2 and 7 in terms of CPU
time. The difference between CPU time and function
evaluation speed-up is due to the extra overhead of
calculating and applying the preconditioner. We also compare
our results to a method from the other competitive class of
large-scale methods, preconditioned truncated Newton method
(TNPACK). The limited results indicate that the
preconditioned L-BFGS method may be more efficient.
<P>
We
also tried this approach in a more general context, using
limited memory with an incomplete Cholesky factorization of
the Hessian as a preconditioner. We compared the performance
with the truncated Newton algorithm TRON, which uses a
similar preconditioner. Tested on a subset of the CUTER test
problems, our results show that, using this preconditioner,
the preconditioned LBFGS method is competitive with TRON and
much better than the LBFGS algorithm without preconditioner.
