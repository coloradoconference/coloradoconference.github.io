Vector quantization is the classical problem of representing
continuum with only a finite number of representatives or
representing an initially rich amount of discrete data with
a lesser amount of representatives. This problem has
numerous applications. The objective of achieving a
quantization with minimal distortion leads to a hard
non-convex optimization problem, typically with many local
minima. The main problem is thus to find an initial
approximation that is close to a ``good'' local minimum.
Once such an approximation is found, the well-known
Lloyd-Max iterative algorithm may be used to converge to the
nearby a local minimum. In this talk we will describe the
problem and present two new approaches to its approximate
solution.
