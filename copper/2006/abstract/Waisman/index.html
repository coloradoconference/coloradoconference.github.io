We present a novel space-time multigrid method for molecular
dynamics simulations. It is aimed at bridging discrete
scales with either coarse grained discrete or continuum
scales. The method consists of the waveform relaxation
scheme aimed at capturing the high frequency response of
atomistic vibrations and a coarse scale solution in space
and time aimed at resolving smooth features of the discrete
medium. The formulation of the coarse grained model is based
on the variational approach derived from Hamilton's
principle. The time integration is performed in windows
using the Newmark predictor-corrector method. The method is
implicit, possesses superior stability properties and
consequently enables larger time steps governed by accuracy
considerations of coarse scale quantities of interest.
Performance studies on polymer melts have shown significant
speed-up compared to the classical explicit methods, in
particular on parallel machines.
