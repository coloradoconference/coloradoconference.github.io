We develop and compare multilevel algorithms for solving
bound constrained nonlinear variational problems via
interior point methods. Several equivalent formulations of
the linear systems arising at each iteration of the interior
point method are compared from the point of view of
conditioning and iterative solution. Furthermore, we show
how a multilevel continuation strategy can be used to obtain
good initial guesses (``hot starts'') for each
nonlinear iteration. A minimal surface problem is used to
illustrate the various approaches.
