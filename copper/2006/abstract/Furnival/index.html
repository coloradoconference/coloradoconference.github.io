We study multigrid for solving the stochastic steady-state
diffusion problem. We operate under the mild assumption that
the diffusion coefficient takes the form of a finite
Karhunen-Lo&#233;ve expansion. The problem is discretized using
a finite element methodology using the polynomial chaos
method to discretize the stochastic part of the problem. We
apply a multigrid algorithm to the stochastic problem in
which the spatial discretization is varied from grid to grid
while the stochastic discretization is held constant. We
then show, theoretically and experimentally, that the
convergence rate is independent of the spatial
discretization, as in the deterministic case.
