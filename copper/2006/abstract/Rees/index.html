We investigate the application of a class of preconditioners
to the problem of solving the linear systems arising from
primal-dual interior point methods in linear and quadratic
programming.  The preconditioners have the attractive
property of improved eigenvalue clustering with increased
singularity of the (1,1) block of the saddle-point matrix.
We analyze spectral properties of the preconditioned matrix
utilizing projections onto the null space of the constraint
matrix.  We then present a practical application of the
preconditioners and study their performance on LP and QP
problems from the NETLIB and QPS test suites.
