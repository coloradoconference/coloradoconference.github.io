The traditional Newton's method requires certain smoothness of
the coefficients of partial differential equations to get local
convergence. In this paper, a multilevel Newton's method is
developed for a two phase model with nonlinear discontinuous
degenerate diffusion coefficient arising in fuel cell
applications. A major finding is that the discrete algebraic
function after using linear finite element method is
Lipschitz continuous.
Numerical example shows the robustness of this method.
