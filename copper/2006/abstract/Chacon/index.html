We present results from our research on Jacobian-free
Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods applied to the time-dependent,
primitive-variable, 3D extended magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
equations. MHD is a fluid description of the plasma state.
While plasma is made up of independent (but coupled) ion and
electron species, the standard MHD description of a plasma
only includes ion time and length scales (one-fluid model).
Extended MHD (XMHD) includes nonideal effects such as
nonlinear, anisotropic transport and two-fluid (Hall and
diamagnetic) effects. XMHD supports so-called dispersive
waves (whistler, ion acoustic), which feature a quadratic
dispersion relation <!-- MATH
 $\omega \sim k^{2}$
 -->

 ALT="$ \omega \sim k^{2}$">. In explicit time
integration methods, this results in a stringent CFL limit
<!-- MATH
 $\Delta t_{CFL}\propto \Delta x^{2}$
 -->

 ALT="$ \Delta t_{CFL}\propto \Delta x^{2}$">, which severely limits
their applicability to the study of long-frequency phenomena
in XMHD.
<P>
A fully implicit implementation promises
efficiency (by removing the CFL constraint) without
sacrificing numerical accuracy [1].
However, the nonlinear
nature of the XMHD system and the numerical stiffness of its
fast waves make this endeavor very difficult. Newton-Krylov
methods can meet the challenge provided suitable
preconditioning is available.
<P>
We propose a successful
preconditioning strategy for the 3D primitive-variable XMHD
formalism. It is based on ``physics-based'' ideas [2,3],
in which a hyperbolic system of
equations (which is diagonally submissive for <!-- MATH

t>\Delta t_{CFL}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$ \Delta
t&gt;\Delta t_{CFL}$">) is ``parabolized'' to arrive to a
diagonally dominant approximation of the original system,
which is multigrid-friendly. The use of approximate
multigrid (MG) techniques to invert the ``parabolized''
operator is a crucial step in the effectiveness of the
preconditioner and the scalability of the overall algorithm.
The parabolization procedure can be properly generalized
using the well-known Schur decomposition of a 2<IMG

block matrix. In the context of XMHD, the resulting Schur
complement is a system of PDEs that couples the three
plasma velocity components, and needs to be inverted in a
coupled manner. Nevertheless, a system MG treatment is still
possible since, when properly discretized, the XMHD Schur
complement is block diagonally dominant by construction, and
block smoothing is effective.
<P>
In this presentation, we
will discuss the derivation and validity of the
physics-based preconditioner for resistive MHD and its
generalization to XMHD, the connection with Schur complement
analysis, and the system-MG treatment of the associated
systems. A novel second-order, cell-centered, conservative
finite-volume discretization has been recently developed [4]
for the XMHD system above, and will be used
in this work. It is suitable for general curvilinear
geometries, solenoidal in <!-- MATH

numerically non-dissipative, and linearly and nonlinearly
stable. We will demonstrate the algorithm using the GEM
challenge configuration [5].
Grid convergence

optimally as <!-- MATH
