Two-grid methods have been developed by Xu (SIAM J.&nbsp;Num.
Anal., 1996) for application to linear and nonlinear PDEs. Of
particular interest are methods that can be applied to large
nonlinear problems that arise in the simulation of physical
processes, such as a method due to Dawson, Wheeler, and
Woodward (SIAM J.&nbsp;Num. Anal., 1998). This scheme solves the
original nonlinear problem on a mesh coarser than originally
specified to capture the nonlinear behavior of the solution,
then utilizes a linearized version of the problem to correct
the coarse approximation on the original problem mesh.

The
two-grid method potentially reduces the overall
computational cost by requiring the solution of a smaller
nonlinear system and a large linear system in place of the
original large nonlinear problem. In this talk we
investigate the application of this method to nonlinear
reaction-diffusion equations. In particular, we discuss
issues that arise in the implementation of the algorithm,
and perform numerical experiments on problems designed to
gauge the performance of the two-grid method relative to a
standard Newton iterative nonlinear solver.
