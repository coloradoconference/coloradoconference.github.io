We consider the symmetric positive semi-definite problems
arising from generalized finite element discretizations on
unstructured grids. The focus will be on a simple two level
approach, in which the coarse grid problem corresponds to
the space spanned by the partition of unity functions. We
characterize the kernel components of the stiffness matrix
for GFEM discretizations in two and three spatial
dimensions. With this characterization in hand, we can
derive a stable decomposition of the underlying GFEM space,
using as an auxiliary coarse space the piece-wise linear and
continuous functions and prove a uniform convergence result
for the resulting two level method.
