In this talk the AMG algorithm for solving the
Scr\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problem is discussed. Its goal is
to approximate the eigenbasis, i.e., all eigenfunctions, of
the Schr\"{o}dinger operator as it appears in the Kohn-Sham
equation.

The algorithm employs multilevel
eigenvalues/eigenfunction representations that allows
approximation of most of the eigenfunctions on the
inexpensive coarse grids and leads to a reduction of both
computational and storage costs. In addition this structure
is beneficial for performance of a variety of applications
essential to the Kohn-Sham equations. Also addressed is the
issue of quality of the obtained sets of eigenfunctions,
such as their accuracy and independence. Numerical results
and discussion of the further extension of the approach will
conclude the talk.
