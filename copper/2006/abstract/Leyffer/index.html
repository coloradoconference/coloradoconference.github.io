Filters have been introduced as an alternative to penalty
functions to promote global convergence for nonlinear
optimization algorithms. A filter borrows ideas from multi-
objective optimization and accepts a trial point whenever
the objective or the constraint violation is improved
compared to previous iterates. We present new filter active
set approaches to nonlinear optimization based on a two-
phase methodology. The first finds an estimate of the
optimal active set, and the second phase performs a Newton
step on the corresponding equality constrained problem. The
approach allows inexact subsystem solves, making it suitable
for PDE constrained optimization. Time permitting we present
numerical experience on large structured optimization
problems.
