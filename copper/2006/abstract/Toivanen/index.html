We consider the computation of time-harmonic acoustic
scattering by objects in layered media. An example of such
problem is the scattering by a mine buried in sediment. The
computational domain can be tens or hundreds of meters long
while the target requires modeling of details smaller than
one centimeter. A discretized problem can have several
billion degrees of freedom.
<P>
We decompose the
computational domain into far-field and near-field domains
and then we perform a finite element discretization. For the
vastly larger far-field domain we use an orthogonal mesh and
a preconditioner based on a fast direct solver. For the
near-field domain a more standard preconditioner can be
used. The combination of these two defines a preconditioner
for the GMRES method. An essential implementation detail is
the reduction of iterations into a small sparse subspace.
Due to this the memory usage is essentially reduced and the
GMRES method can be used without restarts.
<P>
We present
numerical results with two-dimensional and three-dimensional
problems demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed
approach. For example, we show that it is possible to solve
problems with more than a billion degrees of freedom on a
modern PC.
