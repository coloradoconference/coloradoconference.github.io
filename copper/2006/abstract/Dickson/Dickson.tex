Numerical continuation is the process of solving nonlinear
equations of the form \[G(x,\lambda)=0\] for various real
number parameter values, $\lambda$. The obvious approach,
called natural parameterization, is to perturb $\lambda$
with each continuation step and find the corresponding
solution $x$ via a nonlinear solver (Newton's method). While
this approach is reasonable for paths containing only
regular points (points $(x,\lambda)$ where the Jacobian
matrix of $G$ is nonsingular), the approach breaks down at
simple fold points where the Jacobian matrix of $G$ becomes
singular and Newton's method fails.

In order to remedy this,
one may implement pseudoarclength continuation (PAC) which
introduces a new parameter based on the arclength $s$ of the
solution path. In order to implement PAC, one converts the
old problem $G(x,\lambda)=0$ to a new problem
\[F(x(s),\lambda(s))=0.\]
Using PAC on the new problem
requires the Jacobian matrix of $F$, $F'$, which ought to be
nonsingular at both regular points and simple folds if we
have indeed bypassed the problem that natural
parameterization presents.

While the nonsingularity of $F'$
at regular points and simple folds is a known fact, we
present a theorem that gives conditions under which $F'$ is
uniformly nonsingular for a path containing simple folds. We
do this by bounding the smallest singular value of $F'$ from
below. The theorem justifies the use of PAC in a practical
way for solution curves containing nothing ``worse'' than a
simple fold.
