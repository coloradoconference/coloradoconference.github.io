In this paper, the time-harmonic
wave equation in heterogeneous media is solved numerically.
The underlying equation governs wave propagations and
scattering phenomena arising in many area's, e.g., in
aeronautics, geophysics, and optical problems. In
particular, we look for efficient iterative solution
techniques for the Helmholtz equation discretized by finite
difference discretizations. Since the number of grid points
per wavelength should be sufficiently large for accurate
solutions, for very high wavenumbers the discrete problem
becomes extremely large, thus prohibiting the use of direct
solvers. However, since the coefficient matrix is sparse,
iterative solvers are an interesting alternative.
<P>
In many
geophysical applications that are of our interest, an
unbounded domain is used. In our model we approximate such a
domain by a bounded domain, where appropriate boundary
conditions are used to prevent spurious reflections. As
boundary conditions we compare the following possibilities:
Dirichlet, Neumann, Sommerfeld, Absorbing Layer and Perfect
Matched Layer. Due to the boundary conditions and damping in
the heterogeneous medium, the coefficient matrix is
complex-valued.
<P>
It appears that standard iterative
solvers (ILU preconditioned Krylov solver, Multigrid, etc.)
fail for the Helmholtz equation, if the wavenumber becomes
sufficiently high. In this paper we present a Bi-CGSTAB
solution method combined with a novel preconditioner for
high wavenumbers. The preconditioner is based on the inverse
of an Helmholtz operator, where an artificial damping term
is added to the operator. This preconditioner can be
approximated by multigrid. This is somewhat surprising as
multigrid, without enhancements, has convergence troubles
for the original Helmholtz operator at high wavenumbers.
<P>
Currently, we are investigating the best choice of the
damping term. If the damping term is small Bi-CGSTAB
converges fast, but it is difficult to use multigrid for the
preconditioner. On the other hand, if the damping term is
large the multigrid approximation is very good, but the
convergence of Bi-CGSTAB is slow. So a compromise is
required to obtain an efficient solver. To find a good value
of the damping term we study the spectral properties of the
preconditioned matrix. It appears that an eigenvalue 
analysis of this matrix can be used to predict the
convergence of GMRES. In practice it appears that these
insights can also be used for the convergence of Bi-CGSTAB.
We conclude that Bi-CGSTAB combined with the novel
preconditioner converges satisfactorily for all choices of
the boundary conditions.
