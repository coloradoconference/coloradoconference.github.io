We give an overview of the IFISS (<EM>Incompressible Flow
Iterative Solution Software</EM>) Package, a graphical MATLAB
package for the interactive numerical study of
incompressible flow problems. It includes algorithms for
discretization by mixed finite element methods and a
posteriori error estimation of the computed solutions. The
package can also be used as a computational laboratory for
experimenting with state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative
solvers for the discrete linear equation systems that arise
in the modeling of incompressible flow. A unique feature of
the package is its comprehensive nature; for each problem
addressed, it enables the study of both discretization and
iterative solution algorithms as well as the interaction
between the two and the resulting effect on overall
efficiency.
