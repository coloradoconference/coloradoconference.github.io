Many problems in science and engineering require the
solution of a long sequence of linear systems, with small
changes from one matrix to the next but substantial changes
over multiple systems.  We are particularly interested in
cases where both the matrix and the right hand side change
and systems are not available simultaneously.  Such
sequences arise in time-dependent iterations, nonlinear
systems of equations and optimization, (distributed)
parameter identification and inverse problems, and many
other problems.
<P>
In recent papers [1,2,3] we have proposed methods to
recycle selected subspaces from the Krylov spaces generated
for previous linear systems to improve the convergence of
subsequent linear systems.  In this presentation, we
discuss several important convergence issues:
<UL>
<LI>the convergence of Krylov methods
that recycle approximate solution spaces, approximate
invariant subspaces, and other relevant spaces,
</LI>
<LI>the relevant perturbation theory for the spaces
mentioned above for sequences of matrices arising in a
range of applications,
</LI>
<LI>how fast our proposed methods learn to adapt to a
changing problem.
</LI>
</UL>
We provide experimental
results for a range of problems from tomography, nonlinear
mechanics, large-scale design optimization, and statistical
mechanics.
