For PDE problems, Numerical Analysts would always wish to
establish error estimates in `natural' norms for a given
problem. In the context of iterative solution methods there
is similarly the issue of the right norm for convergence:
discrete norms are equivalent, but measuring a convergence
tolerance in a norm in which half of the variables are
scaled by $h^{-5}$ or $h^5$ is definitely not the right
thing to do in general! 

In particular this issue arises
when preconditioning with minimum residual methods because
then monotonic residual reduction occurs in a norm based on
the preconditioner. (For SPD problems and Conjugate
Gradients it is well known that any SPD preconditioning does
not affect the relevant norm). 

In this talk we will
discuss this issue in the context of models of
incompressible flow --- Poisson, Stokes, Advection-Diffusion
and Navier-Stokes problems --- and show how the optimal block
preconditioners developed by Silvester and the author for
the Stokes problem give convergence in the right norm;
comments will also be made regarding Navier-Stokes
preconditioning.

This is joint work with Howard Elman
and David Silvester
