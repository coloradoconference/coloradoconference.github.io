For PDE problems, Numerical Analysts would always wish to
establish error estimates in `natural' norms for a given
problem. In the context of iterative solution methods there
is similarly the issue of the right norm for convergence:
discrete norms are equivalent, but measuring a convergence
tolerance in a norm in which half of the variables are
scaled by <IMG

 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$ h^5$"> is definitely not the right
thing to do in general! 
<P>
In particular this issue arises
when preconditioning with minimum residual methods because
then monotonic residual reduction occurs in a norm based on
the preconditioner. (For SPD problems and Conjugate
Gradients it is well known that any SPD preconditioning does
not affect the relevant norm). 
<P>
In this talk we will
discuss this issue in the context of models of
incompressible flow -- Poisson, Stokes, Advection-Diffusion
and Navier-Stokes problems -- and show how the optimal block
preconditioners developed by Silvester and the author for
the Stokes problem give convergence in the right norm;
comments will also be made regarding Navier-Stokes
preconditioning.

This is joint work with Howard Elman
and David Silvester
