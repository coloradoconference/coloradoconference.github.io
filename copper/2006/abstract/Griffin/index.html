We will discuss an asynchronous parallel implementation of a
derivative-free augmented Lagrangian algorithm for handling
general nonlinear constraints recently proposed by Kolda,
Lewis, and Torczon. The method solves a series of linearly
constrained subproblems, seeking to approximately minimize
the augmented Lagrangian which involves the nonlinear
constraints. Each subproblem is solved using a generating
set search algorithm capable of handling degenerate linear
constraints. We use APPSPACK to solve the
linearly-constrained subproblems, enabling the objective and
nonlinear constraint functions to be computed asynchronously
in parallel. A description and theoretical analysis of the
algorithm will be given followed by numerical results.
