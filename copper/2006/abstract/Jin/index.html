In this talk, we discuss some  parallel multilevel Schwarz
type domain decomposition preconditioned recycling Krylov
subspace method for the numerical solution of some partial
differential equations with stochastic uncertainties in the
operator. Using a Karhunen-Loeve expansion and a finite
element method with double orthogonal polynomial basis, we
transform the stochastic problem into a large number of
deterministic equations. We will report results obtained
from a PETSc based parallel implementation of a recycling
Krylov subspace method with a domain decomposition
preconditioning
