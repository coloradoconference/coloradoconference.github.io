We consider the solution of large scale optimization
problems governed by parabolic partial differential
equations (PDEs). A quadratic functional containing a data
misfit term, is minimized to approximately recover the
parameter function.  The resulting constrained optimization
problem is solved by using the reduced Hessian approach. The
conjugate gradient method (CG) is employed for the solution
of the system involving matrix vector multiplications which
are nontrivial. These matrix vector products do not need to
be computed exactly. We investigate two approaches for
determining the inner iteration tolerance at each CG step
and provide numerical experiments comparing these
approaches.
