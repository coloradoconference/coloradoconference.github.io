In this paper we propose and analyze a scalable
preconditioner for the Wigner-Poisson equations for a
resonant tunneling diode (RTD), and apply that
preconditioner to a matrix-free continuation study of the
dependence of the current through the device on the applied
voltage.

The equations are a integro-partial differential
equation for the distribution of the electrons in the device
couples with Poisson's equation for the electrostatic
potential. Our preconditioner is the inverse of the kinetic
energy operator. We prove that, after elimination of the
Poisson equation, the equation after left preconditioning is
a compact fixed point problem for the Wigner distribution.
We then apply that compactness to show mathematical
scalability of the inner Krylov iteration, and use that to
show scalability of the continuation. We present numerical
results that support the theory.
