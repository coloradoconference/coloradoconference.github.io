We will discuss a multigrid solver for the numerical
solution of the time-dependent Sylvester equation
\begin{equation*} \frac{dX}{dt} = A X + X B + F, \qquad
\text{with $X \in \mathbf{R}^{N\times N}$}, \end{equation*}
where $A$ and $B$ are discretisations of an elliptic PDE
operator. This type of equation occurs in optimal control
problems and in uncertainty propagation algorithms for
partial differential equations with random parameters.
Common to these applications is the large number of unknowns
even for problems with a reasonable mesh width.

 Our
multigrid solver is built on a recently developed algorithm
for the stationary Sylvester equation [1]
$A X + X B + F = 0$.
We exploit the fact that the iterates can be well compressed
when the right hand side $F$ has a low-rank structure. If
this compression is used throughout the multigrid cycle, a
significant reduction in time and memory can be achieved for
large scale problems. This is accomplished by approximating
the unknown $X$ by a low-rank matrix
$$
X \simeq UV^T,
\qquad \mbox{with} \qquad
U,V \in \Reals^{N\times k}.
$$
For a certain precision, this low-rank
multigrid typically requires
$\mathcal{O}(Nk^2) = \mathcal{O}(N\log^2(N))$
work whereas standard multigrid
would require $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. An adaptive strategy that
gradually enlarges the rank to get better precision is
explored.
