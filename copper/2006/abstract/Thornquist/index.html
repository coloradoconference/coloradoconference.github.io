Arnoldi's method is often used to compute a few eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of large, sparse matrices. When the
eigenvalues of interest are not dominant or well-separated,
this method may suffer from slow convergence. Spectral
transformations are a common acceleration technique that
address this issue by introducing a modified eigenvalue
problem that is easier to solve than the original. This
modified problem accentuates the eigenvalues of interest,
but requires solving a linear system, which is
computationally expensive for large-scale eigenvalue
problems.
<P>
In this talk we will show how this expense can
be reduced through a preconditioning scheme that uses a
fixed-polynomial operator to approximate the spectral
transformation. Three different constructions for a
fixed-polynomial operator are derived from some common
iterative methods for non-Hermitian linear systems. The
implementation details and numerical behavior of these three
operators are compared. Numerical experiments will be
presented demonstrating that this preconditioning scheme is
a competitive approach for solving large-scale eigenvalue
problems. The results illustrate the effectiveness of this
technique using several practical eigenvalue problems from
science and engineering ranging from hundreds to more than a
million unknowns.
