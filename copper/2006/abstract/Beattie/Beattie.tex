An approach is described for model reduction of second-order
systems with types of normal mode damping that include the
most common varieties: proportional damping and square-root
damping. We show that unlike the general case that requires
usage of a second-order Krylov subspace structure, one can
build up instead approximating subspaces satisfying all
required conditions much more cheaply as direct sums of
standard rational Krylov subspaces within much smaller
component subspaces.

We give a detailed analysis of the
distribution of system poles, and then, through descriptive
bounds that carry the flavor of classical approximation
theory, we are able to exploit the structure of these poles
to obtain asymptotically optimal shift selection strategies.
Numerical examples are provided to illustrate and support
the analysis.
