Over the past several years, considerable effort has been
placed on developing efficient solution algorithms for the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The effectiveness of
these methods requires that the solution techniques for the
linear subproblems generated by these algorithms exhibit
robust and rapid convergence; These methods should be
insensitive to problem parameters such as mesh size and
Reynolds number. This study concerns a preconditioner
derived from a block factorization of the coefficient matrix
generated in a Newton nonlinear iteration for the primitive
variable formulation of the system. This preconditioner is
based on the approximation of the Schur complement operator
using a technique proposed by Kay, Loghin, and Wathen [1]
and Silvester, Elman, Kay, and Wathen [2]. It is derived
using subsidiary computations (solutions of pressure Poisson
and convection-diffusion-like subproblems) that are
significantly easier to solve than the entire coupled
system, and a solver can be built using tools, such as
smooth aggregation multigrid for the subproblems.

We discuss
a computational study performed using MPSalsa, a stabilized
finite element code, in which parallel versions of these
preconditioners from the pressure convection-diffusion
preconditioners are compared with an overlapping Schwarz
domain decomposition preconditioner.  Our results show
nearly ideal convergence rates for a wide range of Reynolds
numbers on two-dimensional problems with both enclosed and
in/out flow boundary conditions on both structured and
unstructured meshes.
