The speaker will present a new theory, the related
algorithmic and programming architecture for solving
nonlinear boundary value problems with <I>optimal speed
and robustness</I> by using large numbers of finite elements.
<P>
The new methodology will achieve the desired optimality
over a singularly large spectrum of nonlinear finite element
models on bounded domains of <IMG

 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ R^n$"> with <IMG

 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$ n=2$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$ n=3$">.
For example,
the algorithm will cover the Galerkin formulation
of well-posed nonlinear elliptic systems whose principle
part is Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone in a
Sobolev space and certain problems that lack unique
solutions such as stationary Navier-Stokes equations. Large
variations of stiffness will also be permitted in both
magnitude and frequency.
<P>
The merit of the new algorithm
is not only its speed and scope, but also its mathematically
rigorous theory, the elegance in algorithmic design, and
simplicity in implementation. The approach will be based on
the proven success of the speaker's long time effort
starting from early 1990s, recently reported in [1],
which successfully establishes the corresponding
result for second order <I>quasi-linear</I> elliptic systems
with non-negative lower order terms.
<P>
Central to the
algorithm, the speaker will reformulate a finite element
model by generalized Wiener-Hopf equations. This will make
element-wise conditioning an inexpensive process, whereby
reducing the solution procedure to the straightforward
Banach contraction mapping principle: given <IMG

their close variants, which can be accomplished by algebraic
multi-grid method (AMG) in linear computational count.
<P>
For a
large class of practical problems, they can also be
accomplished by a variety of other linear solver techniques,
showing the robustness of the algorithm. From the numerical
point of view, <IMG

 ALT="$ R$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$ R^*$"> are optimal conditioners of <IMG

in terms of cost, efficiency and robustness. They depend
only on a discrete function space modulo the kernel of an
appropriate linear analog of <IMG

 SRC="img9.png"
 ALT="$ T$">. Throughout the algorithmic
design and analysis, non-traditional tools such as
topological spaces and discrete measures will be
systematically deployed for representing and handling the
data structure. This is another novelty of the speaker's
approach from the standard methodology.
<P>
The speaker's
new approach is related neither to Newton-Krylov method and
its variants, nor to FAS. At the philosophical level, it is
a natural extension of AMG to its fully nonlinear analog
without using FAS. It can also be viewed as an extreme
exercise of the <I>finite element tearing and
inter-connection</I> (FETI) philosophy coupled with a novel
treatment of degrees of freedom.
