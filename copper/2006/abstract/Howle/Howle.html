<I>Pressure convection-diffusion</I> preconditioners for
solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were
first proposed by Kay, Loghin, and Wathen and Silvester,
Elman, Kay, and Wathen. While numerous theoretical and
numerical studies have demonstrated mesh independent
convergence for these block methods on several problems and
their overall efficacy, there are several potential
weaknesses remaining in the practical use of these methods.

<P>
Perhaps one of the most poorly understood topics within
this block preconditioner family is the influence of
boundary conditions on overall algorithm convergence. The
notion of differential commuting is the basis for all <I>pressure convection-diffusion</I> preconditioners. The main
mathematical difficulty is that differential commuting does
not hold at the boundaries. Thus, it is unclear what
boundary conditions should be enforced in subblocks of the
preconditioner. Heuristics have been developed that roughly
account for boundary conditions associated with inflow,
outflow, and no-slip. However, these rough heuristics often
do not properly capture the boundary interactions, and can
in fact lead to a degradation in convergence rates as the
mesh is refined. We first explore the effect of having
``ideal'' boundary conditions within the preconditioner.
While not computationally feasible, the ideal boundary
condition results highlight the importance of choosing
suitable boundary conditions. We then explore somewhat more
practical approximations to the ideal conditions based on
ILU factorizations and probing [Siefert and de Sturler,
2005].

<P>
Another important issue is the relationship
between the accuracy of inner sub-problem solves to the
overall convergence rate of the outer iteration. It has been
known for quite some time that when mesh-independent
sub-problem solvers are used inexactly within this block
preconditioner, the overall convergence of the outer
iteration remains mesh independent for the Stokes equations
[Silvester and Wathen, 1994]. The situation is not well
understood for the Navier-Stokes equations, and it is also
not well understood when the inner subblock solver has less
than ideal behavior. We have observed a noticeable
degradation in the outer iteration convergence rate when a
sub-solver is terminated too quickly. We discuss possible
solutions to this issue including reusing information from
repeated linear solves.
