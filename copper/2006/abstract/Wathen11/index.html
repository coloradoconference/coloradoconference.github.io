Saddle-point systems arise widely because they generally
result from any problem with constraints. Hence in Fluid
Mechanics incompressibility is a constraint on the
Navier-Stokes equations, in Optimization algebraic and/or
bound constraints are often applied and in PDE constrained
optimization the PDEs themselves provide the constraints.

This talk is about preconditioned iterative approaches to
the solution of large-scale saddle-point problems based on
preconditioners which preserve the constraints: so-called
constraint preconditioners. We will briefly review the
attractive feature of such preconditioners and then explain
how these preconditioners can effectively be realized
through a block factorization due to Wil Schilders. This
reveals a range of possible approaches where the balance
between faster convergence though better preconditioning and
the cost of the preconditioner varies.

This is joint
work with Sue Dollar, Nick Gould and Wil Schilders
