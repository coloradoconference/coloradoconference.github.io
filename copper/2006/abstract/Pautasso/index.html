We investigate an alternative implementation of
preconditioning techniques for the solution of non-linear
problems. Within the framework of Newton-Krylov methods,
preconditioning techniques are needed to improve the
performance of the solvers. We use a different
implementation approach to re-utilize existing semi-implicit
methods to precondition fully implicit non-linear schemes.
We use a predictor- corrector approach where the fully
non-linear scheme is the corrector and the pre- existing
semi-implicit scheme is the predictor [1,2]. The advantage
of the proposed approach is that it allows to retrofit
existing codes, with only minor modifications, in particular
avoiding the need to reformulate existing methods in terms
of variations, as required instead by other approaches now
currently used.
<P>
A classic problem of computational
science and engineering is the search for an efficient
numerical scheme for solving non-linear time-dependent
partial differential equations. Explicit and semi-implicit
methods can provide simple solution techniques but are
seriously limited by time step limitations for stability
(explicit methods) and accuracy (semi-implicit methods).
<P>
Recently, significant progress has been made in the
development of fully implicit approaches for solving
nonlinear problems: the Newton-Krylov (NK) method. The
method is developed from the Newton iterative method, by
applying a linear iterative solver to the Jacobian equation
for the Newton step and terminating that iteration when a
suitable convergence criterion holds.
<P>
For the solution of
the linear Jacobian equation, Krylov methods are often the
choice, leading to the Newton-Krylov (NK) approach. However,
for most cases, Krylov solvers can be extremely inefficient.
The need for good preconditioners techniques becomes a
constraining factor in the development of NK solvers.
<P>
In
a number of fields, recent work based on multi-grid and
physics-based preconditioners[3] have demonstrated extremely
competitive performances.
<P>
In the present study, we
discuss a different implementation of preconditioning: the
predictor-corrector (PC) preconditioner [1,2]. The approach
has two novelties. First, it preconditions directly the
non-linear equations rather than the linear Jacobian
equation for the Newton step. The idea is not
new, but it is implemented here in a new way
that leads to great simplifications of the implementation.
We note that this simplification is designed also to
minimize the effort in refitting existing semi-implicit
codes into full fledged implicit codes, representing perhaps
a greater advance in software engineering than in
computational science. Second, we test new ways of
preconditioning the equations by using a combination of
predictor-corrector semi-implicit preconditioning.
<P>
The
fundamental idea is to use a predictor to advance a
semi-implicit discretization of the governing equations and
use a corrector Newton step to correct for the initial state
of the predictor step. The typical NK solver is used to
compute the unknown value of the state vector at the end of
the time step <!-- MATH

method to iterate for a modification of the actual known
state <!-- MATH

predictor step give the solution of the fully implicit
method.
<P>
Two advantages are obvious. First, the actual
previous state <IMG

predictor than it is for the final state of the corrector
step. Second, by modifying the non-linear function and
consequently modifying the Jacobian equation, the PC
preconditioner modifies the spectral properties of the
Jacobian matrix in the same way as preconditioners applied
directly to the Jacobian equation. Indeed, as shown below
the PC preconditioner gives the same type of speed-up of the
Krylov convergence without requiring to formulate an actual
preconditioning of the Krylov solver.
<P>
We use a suite of
problems, including non-linear diffusion [2] and the standard
driven cavity flow problem [1], as benchmarks to demonstrate
the performance and the reliability of the PC
preconditioning method.
