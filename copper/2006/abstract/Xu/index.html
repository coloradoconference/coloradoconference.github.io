A new class of optimal solvers
will be presented for H (curl) and H(div) systems in terms of
Poisson Solvers. As a direct application, optimal AMG solvers can
be obtained for H(curl) and H (div) systems whenever optimal AMG
solvers are available for Poisson equations. Both theoretical and
numerical examples will be given. This work is in joint with Ralf
Hiptmair.
