strategies must be used. However, many conventional
pre-conditioning strategies rely on sparsity in the matrix,
and applying them to these dense matrices requires
computations that have a formal time or memory complexity of

We
explore the application of two preconditioning strategies to
the FMM. In the first, which was applied to the FMM solution
of a multiple scattering problem for the Helmholtz equation
in three dimensions, the system was solved using the
flexible GMRES algorithm. The choice of the (right)
preconditioning matrix was based on GMRES solution of a
linear system with an approximation to the matrix that is
based on a partitioning that is performed in the FMM itself.
We describe details of this iterative technique and its
performance on some large multiple scattering problems.
<P>
In the second iterative solution, we consider an iterative
algorithm of Faul et al. [1] for the solution of the
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation problem. In this
problem the goal is to construct an interpolating function
for a set of scattered data points, with the interpolating
function expressed as a sum of RBFs centered at the data
points. The iterative algorithm of Faul et al. can be
accelerated by the use of the FMM for the matrix vector
product required at each step. There however is a
precomputation stage that requires the construction of
approximate cardinal function interpolants centered at each
data point and <IMG

 ALT="$ q$"> of its neighbors <IMG
 WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$ (q\ll N)$">, that are
carefully selected. These interpolants are used to provide a
Krylov basis for the iteration. The complexity of these
preliminary calculations in Faul et al. is <IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$ O(N^2)$">.
We provide a modification to this set-up stage and reduce
its complexity to linear order. Results will be presented
for the interpolation of large data sets in two and three
dimensions using multiquadric and polyharmonic radial basis
functions.
