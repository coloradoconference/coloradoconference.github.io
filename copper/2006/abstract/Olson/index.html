<p>
In this talk we highlight recent attempts to solve systems
of equations arising from high-order spectral element
discretizations. In particular, we extend the success of
Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioning on structured
grids to the unstructured case (using triangles).
<P>
We
consider high-order nodal spectral elements based on the
electrostatic distribution. A low-order finite element
preconditioner is utilized and accelerated with Conjugate
Gradient. The elements cause a particular challenge as the
local grids are also unstructured and suffer from poor
aspect ratios. We present numerical evidence in support of
this method and discuss the implications of using this
approach.
