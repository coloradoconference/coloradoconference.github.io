In most scenarios, traditional multigrid methods fail to
converge in the case of the Helmholtz equation with
relatively large wave numbers. One approach for tackling
this problem is to use a Krylov type algorithm both as a
smoother and as an outer iteration method in the multigrid
cycles. In this presentation, we extend this methodology to
the iteration methods based on the cascadic principle. Such
algorithms are usually referred to as one-way multigrid
methods. We consider an adaptive control strategy for the
number of iterations on successive refinement levels and
present numerical results that illustrate the efficiency of
the proposed approach.
