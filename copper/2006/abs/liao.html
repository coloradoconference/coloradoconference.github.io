<DIV>Dear Ms. Lee,<BR></DIV>
<DIV>I sent it on Feb 23. </DIV>
<DIV>In case of missing, the followings are the title and abstract of my 
paper.<BR><BR>Thanks, Ben-Shan Liao<BR><BR>----<BR><BR>Title: An iterative 
projection method for solving large-scale nonlinear<BR>eigenproblems with 
application to next-generation accelerator design </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Abstract:<BR><BR>The emerging needs to solve large-scale nonlinear 
eigenvalue problems<BR>arising in many engineering applications have come into 
notice. More<BR>researches have been conducted on efficient algorithm 
development and<BR>computational theory. However, the nonlinearity varying 
greatly from problem<BR>to problem results in a challenging computational task. 
Instead of<BR>considering arbitrary nonlinear eigenvalue problems, we consider a 
certain<BR>type of problems for robust and efficient algorithm developments. 
This<BR>particular type nonlinear eigenvalue problems consist of a dominated 
linear<BR>and positive definite pencil and a ``small" nonlinear component. A 
number of<BR>applications give rise of nonlinear eigenvalue problems of such 
type.<BR>Examples include vibration study of fluid solid structures 
and<BR>eigencomputation problem from fiber optic design.<BR><BR>In this talk, a 
nonlinear eigenvalue problem we particular interested in is<BR>from the finite 
element analysis of the resonant frequencies and external Q<BR>of a waveguide 
loaded cavity, as currently be studied by researchers for<BR>next-generation 
accelerator design. We study iterative subspace projection<BR>methods, such as 
nonlinear Arnoldi method. We focus on the critical stages<BR>of algorithms, such 
as the choice of initial projection subspace, and the<BR>expansion and the 
refinement of projection subspace. We present a notable<BR>improvement over the 
early iterative projection methods in our case study.<BR></DIV>
