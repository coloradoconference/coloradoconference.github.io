Title:		Optimal Solvers for H(curl) and H(div) systems in terms of  
Poisson Solvers

Abstract:		A new class of optimal solvers will be presented for H 
(curl) and H(div) systems in terms of Poisson Solvers.  As a direct  
application,  optimal AMG solvers can be obtained for H(curl) and H 
(div) systems whenever  optimal AMG solvers are available for Poisson  
equations.    Both theoretical and numerical examples will be  
given.   This work is in joint with Ralf Hiptmair,
