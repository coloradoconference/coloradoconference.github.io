Title:  Preconditioned Iterative Methods for Stochastic Partial
Differential Equations

 

Abstract:

 

In this talk, we discuss some  parallel multilevel Schwarz type
domain

decomposition preconditioned recycling Krylov subspace method for

the numerical solution of some partial differential equations with
stochastic

uncertainties in the operator. Using a Karhunen-Loeve expansion and a

finite element method with double orthogonal polynomial basis, we
transform

the stochastic problem into a large number of deterministic
equations. We

will report results obtained from a PETSc based parallel
implementation of a recycling Krylov subspace method with a domain
decomposition preconditioning

 

thanks!

Dear Chao Jin,
Thank you for your submission to our student paper competition for
the Tenth Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods. Although
your paper was well received we regret that your entry was not chosen
as one of the top three. However, we invite you to give a talk on
your paper at our conference in one of our regular sessions.

If you choose to accept our offer, you will be given free lodging and
free registration. You will be responsible for your own travel
arrangements. You should plan to arrive Sunday April 2nd and depart
Friday late afternoon April 7th. Please register online as a student
and mark the box ^Spaying later with a credit card^T.  In addition do
not make any lodging reservations for yourself. Our staff will make
these arrangements for you and before you arrive you will receive
information on your accommodations. You will be sharing a two-bedroom
4-bed suite with 3 other students. Cathy Lee, our conference
coordinator, will be your contact while you are attending the
conference. We also need you to submit an abbreviated HTML version of
your paper. You need to submit it to: copper.conference@colorado.edu
Thank you again for your interest in the student paper competition.
We look forward to meeting you in April.

Sincerely,

Howard Elman
