Title: An OcTree Multigrid Method for Quasi-Static
       Maxwells Equations with Highly Discontinuous Coefficients

By:    Eldad Haber and Stefan Heldmann

Abstract:
In this work we develop an OcTree discretization for Maxwells
equations in the quasi-static regime. We then use this discretization
in order to develop a multigrid method for Maxwells equations with
highly discontinuous coefficients. We show that our approach can be
interpreted as a semi-algebraic multigrid method with physical base
for coarse grid selection.

We test our algorithms and compare it to other multilevel algorithms.
