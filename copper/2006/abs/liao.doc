Title: An iterative projection method for solving large-scale
nonlinear
eigenproblems with application to next-generation accelerator design
 
Abstract:

The emerging needs to solve large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue problems
arising in many engineering applications have come into notice. More
researches have been conducted on efficient algorithm development and
computational theory. However, the nonlinearity varying greatly from
problem
to problem results in a challenging computational task. Instead of
considering arbitrary nonlinear eigenvalue problems, we consider a
certain
type of problems for robust and efficient algorithm developments.
This
particular type nonlinear eigenvalue problems consist of a dominated
linear
and positive definite pencil and a ``small" nonlinear component. A
number of
applications give rise of nonlinear eigenvalue problems of such type.
Examples include vibration study of fluid solid structures and
eigencomputation problem from fiber optic design.

In this talk, a nonlinear eigenvalue problem we particular interested
in is
from the finite element analysis of the resonant frequencies and
external Q
of a waveguide loaded cavity, as currently be studied by researchers
for
next-generation accelerator design. We study iterative subspace
projection
methods, such as nonlinear Arnoldi method. We focus on the critical
stages
of algorithms, such as the choice of initial projection subspace, and
the
expansion and the refinement of projection subspace. We present a
notable
improvement over the early iterative projection methods in our case
study.
