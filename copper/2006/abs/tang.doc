Abstract paper:

Recently, simulating bubbly flows is a very popular topic in CFD. These bubbly 
flows are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. In many popular operator 
splitting formulations for these equations, solving the linear system coming 
from the discontinuous Poisson equation takes the most computational time, 
despite of its elliptic origins. ICCG is widely used for this purpose, but 
for complex bubbly flows this method shows slow convergence. 

Moreover, new insights are given into the properties of invertible and 
singular deflated and preconditioned linear systems, where the coefficient
matrices are symmetric and positive (semi-) definite. These linear
systems can be derived from a discretization of the Poisson equation with 
Neumann boundary conditions. Sometimes these linear systems are forced to be 
invertible leading to a worse (effective) condition number. If ICCG is used 
to solve this problem, the convergence is significantly slower than for the 
case of the original singular problem. 

We show that applying the deflation technique, which leads to the DICCG 
method, remedies the worse condition number and the worse convergence of 
ICCG. Moreover, some useful equalities are derived from the deflated variants 
of the singular and invertible matrices, which are also generalized to 
preconditioned methods. It appears that solving the invertible and singular 
linear systems with DICCG leads to exactly the same convergence results.

This new method DICCG incorporates the eigenmodes corresponding to the 
components which caused the slow convergence of ICCG. Coarse linear systems 
have to be solved within DICCG. We discuss some methods to do this 
efficiently which results in two approaches DICCG1 and DICCG2. 

Therafter we show with numerical experiments that both DICCG approaches are 
very efficient and they emphasize also the theoretical results. Compared to 
ICCG, DICCG decreases significantly the number of iterations and the 
computational time as well which are required for solving Poisson equation in 
applications of 2-D and 3-D bubbly flows.
