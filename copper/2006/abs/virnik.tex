\begin{abstract}
We will consider the problem of the computation of stationary distributions of Markov chains which arrises in many different application areas. These range from the distribution of drugs in the blood circulation systems to the Page Rank computed by Google. The task is to compute the left eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix $T$ or alternatively solve the linear system
$$(I-T^T)x=0,$$
where the matrix $(I-T^T)$ is a singular $M$-matrix. In applications, these matrices are large and sparse. Therefore, iterative methods such as GMRES are applied. However, the applicability of GMRES depends on whether it is possible to find a suitable preconditioner. For non-singular, symmetric positive definite M-matrices that are obtained from discretisations of boundary value problems the algebraic multigrid is well known to be a good preconditioner. We show how it is possible to apply the algebraic multigrid method to our special case of singular non-symmetric $M$-matrices and show numerical examples that illustrate that this leads to significant acceleration of the convergence speed.
