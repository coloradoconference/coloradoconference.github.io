         A quantitative theory of the structure of molecular fluids
          described by atoms or sites has remained elusive in soft
           condensed matter theory. Many-body and field theoretic
        approaches to the correlations liquids have advanced slowly
            since the 1930~Rs. The qualitative and quantitative
       inconsistencies of the many-body integral equation theory for
       predicting the structure and thermodynamic properties of model
        molecular fluids have been understood for some time. Several
         means have been proposed to correct these inconsistencies,
          many concentrating on the Goldstone theorem. A formally
         distinct method for constructing a diagrammatically proper
        theory eliminates terms in the expansion which correspond to
          unphysical intramolecular interactions, or so-called bad
         graphs. Unfortunately, while certain qualitative advances
       using the proper theory have been successful the quantitative
       results appear to be uniformly disappointing in comparison to
         simulation. We present a new derivation from a topological
       expansion of a model for the single atom activity followed by
        a topological reduction and low order truncation. This leads
           to an approximate numerical value for the new density
          coefficient. The resulting equations give a substantial
         improvement over the standard construction as shown with a
                series of simple diatomic model simulations.

            Hi Tim,
            I need the abstract by March 2. We have a
            deadline to get to the printer.

                  Hi Monte,

                  I'm just back from a month Hong
                  Kong, and am leaving for Germany
                  today. You get 25 mins + 5 for
                  questions. Overview + current
                  stuff is fine, if you can talk
                  about the issues with stability
                  under picard iteration, that'd be
                  good. Beardmore will be there.

                  Cathy + Panayot, please keep
                  Monte's slot open and wait until
                  next week for the abstract?
