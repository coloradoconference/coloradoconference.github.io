<body bgcolor="#7fffff">


<a name="14"><h2>STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION</h2>
Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to student
and new Ph.D.  authors judged to have the best research
papers. Any student or new PH.D. whose degree was awarded
after Jan 1, 2005, is eligible to submit a paper.  Papers
containing original research due mainly to the student must
be received before Jan. 10, 2006. The student must be the
primary author and the paper may be no more than 10 pages
in length. Sending only an abstract is unacceptable.  A
panel of judges will determine the best papers.  Authors of
the best papers will be given a travel stipend, free
lodging, and registration, and each will be expected to
present their paper in one of the regular conference
sessions.

<p>
We will also provide some support for up to five more
students who submit acceptable papers.
