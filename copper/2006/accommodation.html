Make your room reservation directly with Copper Mountain
before March 2, 2006. <strong> Availability of rooms cannot be
guaranteed after March 2--Copper Mountain reserves the
right to release part of our room block if 50% of our block
is not reserved at this time.</strong>  After March 2, all
remaining unreserved rooms will be released from our group,
and in 2005 we did indeed run out of rooms.

State and local taxes (10.85%) will be added to the cost of the room.
Rates prior to April 2 are higher.  If available, group rates
will be given 2 days before and after the conference.  Identify
yourself with the 2006 CU Math Conference Group code #3FF46M to get group rates.
At time of reservation, a credit card number can hold the room, or
you will be asked to send in 1 night's deposit within 14 days.
