<a name="14"><h2>STUDENT PAPERS</h2>
Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to student and new Ph.D.
authors judged to have the best research papers. Any student or new PH.D. whose degree was awarded after Jan 1, 2001, is eligible to submit a paper.  Papers
containing original research due mainly to the student must be
received before Jan. 10, 2002. The student must be the primary author and the paper 
may be no more than 10 pages in length. Sending only
an abstract is unacceptable.  A panel of judges will determine
the best papers.  Authors of the best papers will
be given a travel stipend, free lodging, and registration, and
each will be expected to present their paper in one of the regular
conference sessions. 
We will also provide some support for up to five more
students who submit acceptable papers.
Student papers should be submitted as ps files by
<a link href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">e-mail</a>.
If this is not possible, a hard copy of the paper may
be submitted by regular post to:
<pre>
CMCIM02
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO
DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATH
CAMPUS BOX 526
BOULDER CO 80309-0526 
</pre>
<p>
Postdocs 
are not considered "students" for this competition--nor are they eligible
for student registration fees.
