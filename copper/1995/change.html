<h2> COPPER MOUNTAIN CONFERENCE: Change of dates </h2>

 
Due to incorrect estimates by Copper Mountain Resorts of their low
season schedule, we have found it advisable to move the conference
back one week. We apologize if this has caused any inconvenience.
However, we will also take this opportunity to change the cost of
student registration: it is now gratis. Please encourage students
to attend and/or submit a paper to the student competition!
