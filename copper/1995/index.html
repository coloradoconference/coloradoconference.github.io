<p> <b> CIRCUS AND WORKSHOPS </b>
<br>
Anyone who wants to give a talk and will not be in the regular
session may do so at one of the Circus sessions.  Each session will
begin by asking who wishes to speak and setting the Circus schedule
accordingly.  To provide a more informal atmosphere for discussion,
there will also be time set aside for Workshops on specific topics
of interest.  The schedule for the Circus and Workshops will be
determined each day according to demand.

<p> <b> STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION </b>
<br>
Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to
students judged to have the best research
papers.  Papers with original research due mainly
to the student must be received before December
1, 1994.  They must be singly authored and no
more than 10 pages in length.  Sending only an
abstract is unacceptable. A panel of judges will
determine the best papers. Authors of the three
best papers will be given a travel stipend, free
lodging, and registration, and will be expected
to present their papers in a special session at
the conference.  Several other students who
participate in the competition may be awarded
free lodging and registration, depending on
availability of funds.

<p> <b> FORMAT </b>
<br>
There will be morning and late afternoon lectures
of approximately 25 minutes each.  Evenings will
be reserved for the Circus and Workshops.
Afternoons will be open for more informal
workshops and discussions.
