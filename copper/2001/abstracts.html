<a name="8"><h2>SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS</h2>  
<p>
In order to guarantee a spot in the program, each speaker will
be asked to submit an abstract by February 1, 2001.  Abstracts
will only be accepted from the <em>intended speaker</em>.
In the list of papers that we will eventually post, we will
include the name of the person who submitted
the abstract as the speaker along with a
link to the email address used in the submission.
Authours must submit html versions of
their abstracts, so symbols should not be used, or at least
they should be kept to a minimum. <a href="abstract.txt"> Click here </a> 
to display the html form
for submitting your abstract. Also, anyone who wants
to expand on their abstract is encouraged to submit a ps
file to the MGNet Virtual Proceedings described <a href="#11">below</a>.
<em> Abstracts are limited to two pages! Please heed this limitation 
because longer abstracts will be truncated in the Handbook of Abstracts
</em> described <a href="#10">below</a>.}

<a name="10"><h2>HANDBOOK OF ABSTRACTS</h2>
We will provide a bound collection of abstracts to the participants
at the conference. It will include the two-page abstracts together
with a schedule and important notices. This should make it easier
to select which lectures and special sessions to attend.

you have as many pages as you wish,
