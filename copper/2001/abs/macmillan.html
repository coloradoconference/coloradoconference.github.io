The practical limitations of electrical impedance tomography
(EIT), due to both the necessarily finite set of inexact boundary
data and the diffusive nature of the current into the interior,
lead to the conclusion that reconstructing the interior impedance
is an ill-posed problem. Given a set of applied normal boundary
currents, a standard approach to EIT is to minimize the defect
between the known and the computed boundary voltages that are
associated, respectively, with the exact impedance and its
approximation. In minimizing a boundary functional, standard
least-squares approaches implicitly impose the interior partial
differential equation (PDE), the diffusion equation. We have
developed and implemented a first-order system least-squares
(FOSLS) formulation which incorporates the elliptic PDE in a
global multigrid minimization scheme. To place the new functional in
context, we establish its equivalence to existing least-squares
approaches, and to a novel norm on the error in the approximate
impedance. The effect of this equivalence is to guarantee that,
for each formulation, there is a unique minimizer in the topology
corresponding to this special norm.  Thus, the theory quantifies
the sense in which the fully nonlinear inverse problem is well
posed, and guides the discretization according to those components
which we can expect to reconstruct, regardless of the
computational objective. With this framework established, {\it a
priori} information, which might otherwise be used to regularize,
can be incorporated by introducing an additional term to the
functional.
