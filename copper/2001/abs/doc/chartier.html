<p>
AMGe is an algebraic multigrid method for solving discretizations that
arise in Ritz-type finite element methods for partial differential
equations.  Assuming access to the element stiffness matrices, Spectral
AMGe uses the spectral decomposition of small collections of element
stiffness matrices to determine local representations of algebraically
"smooth" error components.  This decomposition provides the basis for
generating a coarse grid and for defining effective interpolation.  Recent
results will be presented for problems such as linear elasticity.
