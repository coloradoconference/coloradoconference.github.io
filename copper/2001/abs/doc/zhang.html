A fourth order compact finite difference scheme (nine point compact
difference scheme) and a multigrid cycling algorithm are employed
to solve the two dimensional convection diffusion equations with
boundary layers. The computational domain is first discretized on a
nonuniform (stretched) grid to resolve the boundary layers. A grid
transformation technique is used to map the nonuniform grid to a
uniform one. The fourth order compact scheme is applied to the
transformed uniform grid. A multigrid method is then used to solve
the resulting linear system. We conduct experimental analyses to show 
how the grid stretching may affect the computed accuracy of the solutions
from the fourth order compact scheme. We demonstrate that the grid
stretching may affect the convergence rate of the multigrid
method. Numerical experiments are used to show that a graded mesh
and a grid transform are necessary to compute high accuracy solution
with the fourth order compact scheme for convection diffusion problems
with boundary layers. Accuracy comparisons between the standard
(central and upwind) difference schemes and the present fourth order
compact scheme are given. Special properties of the transformed
convection diffusion equation that may affect multigrid
convergence are investigated.
