<p>
In this talk we will present a result on the asymptotic
behavior of the contraction numbers of multigrid V-cycle
algorithms with respect to the number of smoothing steps.
This result is obtained using an additive convergence theory 
and new estimates for mesh-dependent norms.  When combined
with earlier results of Zhang, Bramble and Pasciak, it yields
a generalization of the classical convergence theorem of
Braess and Hackbusch to problems without full elliptic regularity.
