<p>
Interface coupling of independently modeled structural and other
multiphysics computational modules is emerging as a key procedure for
local refinements, contact-impact modeling, and parallel simulation
employing partitioned domains. In the first part of this paper, we
present a localized version of the method of Lagrange multipliers whose
key feature  is the use of frames that
lie between the partitioned domains and that facilitate localized
interface coupling as opposed to global coupling inherent when employing
the classical method of Lagrange multipliers.

In the second part of the paper we present a selection of its
applications to the coupling of non-matching interfaces and contact
problems. In particular, we present an interface patch test criterion
that can be employed a priori for the construction of patch test-passing
interfaces.  The resulting coupling procedure satisfies a priori the
interface patch test when the interfaces are discretized with different
non-matching meshes. Example are finally discussed, which demonstrate the
utility of the present method as compared to the master-slave method, the
mortar method and the so-called three-field method.
