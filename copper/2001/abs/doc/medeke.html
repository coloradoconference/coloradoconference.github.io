<br> Based on a Schur complement approach we present an algebraic multilevel 
preconditioning technique for large, sparse and totally disordered systems. 
</center>

<p>
We focus on the Schwinger model which is an ideal laboratory to 
develop and to test preconditioners for discretizations of lattice 
fermions since it has many features in common with lattice QCD. The 
corresponding Schwinger matrices represent a nearest neighbor coupling 
on a regular two-dimensional lattice. In general, the Schwinger matrices 
are large, sparse and structured but totally disordered.   

<p>

In contrast to the original system, an initial odd-even reduction enables us
to distinguish between strong and weak edges in the digraph induced by the 
odd-even reduced system. The F-sites are chosen to be a maximal independent 
vertex set of the reduced digraph consisting of the vertex set and the set
of strong edges.  Although the F-sites are selected algebraically, 
the resulting F/C partitioning of the even lattice sites can be easily fixed 
in advance such that costly coarsening strategies become obsolete.   

<p>

To precondition the subsystem residing on the F-sites only, standard incomplete
LU preconditioners (ILU) are considered. Rigorous bounds of the condition number
of the preconditioned submatrix are given. An appropriate and easy to construct 
Schur complement approximation is proposed. With respect to the odd-even reduced 
system no fill-in occurs so that the Schur complement preconditioner allows a 
recursive procedure on coarse lattices. 

<p>

The algebraic multilevel preconditioner is compared with standard
odd-even preconditioning. Numerical experiments indicate that the 
Schur complement preconditioner outperforms the standard odd-even 
preconditioner.
