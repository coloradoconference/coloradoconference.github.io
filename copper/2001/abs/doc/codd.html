<p>
Elliptic Grid Generation (EGG), using the Winslow generator, defines a map
between a simple computational region and a potentially complicated
physical region. It can be used numerically to create meshes for
discretizing equations directly on the physical domain or indirectly on
the computational domain by way of the transforming map. EGG allows
complete specification of the boundary, and it guarantees a one-to-one and
onto transformation when the computational region is convex.

A new fully variational approach is developed for solving the Winslow
equations that enables accurate discretization and fast solution methods.
The EGG equations are converted to a first-order system that is then
linearized via Newton's method. First-order system least squares (FOSLS)
is used to formulate and discretize the Newton step, and the resulting
matrix equation is solved using algebraic multigrid (AMG). The approach is
coupled with nested iteration to provide an accurate initial guess for
finer levels using coarse-level computation. Theoretical and numerical
results confirm the usual full multigrid efficiency: accuracy comparable
to the finest-level discretization is achieved at a cost proportional to
the number of finest-level degrees of freedom.
