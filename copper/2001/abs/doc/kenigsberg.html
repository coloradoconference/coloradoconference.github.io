Image segmentation is a basic and important problem in the field
of computer vision. A recent geometric approach for image
segmentation is the geodesic active contour based on the level-set
method. One drawback of the method, is the extended numerical
support that makes its solution time consuming. We propose to solve an
implicit system of the geodesic active contour model using the
computationally efficient multigrid method.
