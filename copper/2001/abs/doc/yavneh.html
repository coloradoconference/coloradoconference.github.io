<p>
We apply a new algebraic multigrid method for solving computer vision 
problems with constraints, in particular "shape from photometric 
stereo". A variational formulation is applied to the problem 
of shape reconstruction from three or more images of an object with 
the same viewing direction and different lighting conditions,
supplemented by some pointwise height constraints. In order to
obtain a smooth reconstruction, we choose a weight-function 
that is singular at the constrained points, resulting in 
an elliptic equation with constraints and 
singular coefficients, which is 
solved efficiently by our algebraic multigrid algorithm.
