<p>
Solvers play a crucial role in many simulations
determinig the complexity of the whole process. Thus
solving often limits the obtainable accuracy and fast
solver even are the key to simulate new challenging
problems.

In the lecture multigrid methods for the simulation of
large porous media flow problems are discussed.  Problems
like heterogeneity, non-M-matrices etc. are addresseed.
Further adaptivity and parallelism is discussed. The software
system UG is presented which is based on these
strategies. In several application cases the efficiency of
the selected approach is shown.
