<p>
The investigated ocean modeling code bases on a 
five layer model using higher order spectral elements 
for discretization  
and a special filtering technique 
for the vortex and divergence field. 

These filterings contain the solving of the Laplace equation 
for the velocity components in x- and y-direction 
cause on each layer most of the arithmetic work per time step. 
The system matrix is never accumulated and so all 
matrix operations are performed 
on an element level with the small dense 
element matrices. 

We have the special situation that the system matrix and the 
filtering matrix are the same for both directions and 
for all layers. This gave us the chance 
to redesigning the code such that all layers and directions 
can be handled simultaneously. 
The general reduction of memory accesses together with  
cache aware data structures improve the run time significantly. 

These techniques can be also used very successfully when 
the pcg solver uses multigrid as preconditioner.
