<p>

Radiation transport equations arise in the study of many different fields,
such as combustion, astrophysics and hypersonic flow. The solution of
these equations presents interesting challenges due to large jumps in the
coefficients and strong non-linearities. In this talk we plan to compare
the parallel efficiency of several techniques that may be used to solve
these non-linear equations. 
<p> 
Under certain physical assumptions, such
as isotropic radiation, optically thick material and temperature
equilibrium, radiation transport may be modeled by a system of three
non-linear equations. As a first approach we consider the case where all
energies are in equilibrium and the system is reduced to a single highly
non-linear equation. The radiation may travel through inhomogeneous
material, which translates into large jumps in the coefficients.
Furthermore, a flux limiter is often included and it changes the equations
from being locally parabolic to hyperbolic. As a consequence of all of
these features, the equations are very difficult and time
 consuming to solve. 
<p> 
To be able to solve the types of problems we are
interested in we need to look at algorithms that show both parallel
scalability and algorithmic scalability, ignoring one of these aspects
means that we can not fully exploit available resources and will fall
short of our goals. Techniques such as the multigrid method and adaptive
finite elements have good algorithmic scalability, we want to measure
their parallel scalability in relation to the radiation transport
equations. Specifically, we shall focus on the performance of an inexact
Newton multigrid scheme and compare it with the Full Approximation Scheme
(FAS). Furthermore, we will also look at how the use of adaptive
refinement affect the solution time. </body> </html>
