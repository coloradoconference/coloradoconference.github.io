In this talk, we present two efficient multigrid time stepping schemes for
scalar linear and nonlinear wave equations based on a upwind biased
interpolation and restriction, and a nonstandard coarse grid update
formula. Furthermore, we prove that these schemes preserve monotonicity
and are total variation diminishing (TVD). Thus, no numerical oscillation
is introduced, resulting in fast wave propagation to the steady state.

<p>
Multigrid for solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs)
has been proven, both numerically and theoretically, to be a successful
and powerful techniques. Efficient multigrid methods have also been
proposed for solving non-elliptic equations, in particular, Euler
and Navier Stokes equations. One approach is to accelerate the evolution
of a hyperbolic system to a
steady state on multiple grids by taking larger time steps on
coarse grids without violating the stability condition. Thus, the low
frequency disturbances are rapidly expelled through the outer boundary
whereas the high frequency errors are locally damped. It can be proved
that an M-level multigrid cycle consisting of one smoothing
step on each coarse grid results in an effective time step of the sum
of the time steps of all the coarser grids.

<p>
While the above approach has achieved great success, for instance, in
Euler calculations, the understanding of the numerical property is
relatively limited and analyses are scarce.
In this paper, two efficient multigrid time stepping schemes proposed by
Jameson is studied and extended for the steady state solution of
scalar linear and nonlinear wave equations. One scheme
is multiplicative in nature and the other additive. Thus the former is
usually more effective but the latter is more parallel.
The upwind biased interpolation and restriction are defined based on the
characteristic directions. As opposed to elliptic multigrid,
they are not transpose of each other. For nonlinear wave equations, the
characteristic directions change at every grid points and in every time
steps. To define the appropriate upwind interpolation and restriction, we
solve a local Riemann problem which determines locally the characteristic
direction. Up to the authors' knowledge, Riemann solutions have not
been used in the context of multigrid interpolation/restriction.

<p>
In addition, we present the numerical analysis of these schemes;
the primary focus is on the monotonicity preserving and total variation
diminishing properties. Both concepts are fundamental in designing
discretization schemes for conservation laws, but nevertheless, have never
been used to analyze multigrid methods in the literature.
We prove that both the two-level multiplicative and additive schemes
preserve monotonicity and are TVD; and the same holds for the multilevel
additive scheme.
Finally, numerical results for solving the linear wave equation and the
nonlinear Burgers' equation in one and two dimensions are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and verify that no
oscillation occurs during the multigrid time stepping.
