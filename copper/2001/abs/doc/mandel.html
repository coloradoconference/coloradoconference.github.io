A-priori estimates of approximation of fine grid functions by
coarse grid functions are important for the design of
robust Algebraic Multigrid methods. A number of coarsening
schemes will work well on an easy problem, such as a the Laplace
equation discretized by linear elements on a reasonable unstructured 
grid. Methods that incorporate rigid body modes, such as
[1], work also very well for elasticity. Realistic problems, however,
typically include elements violating shape limits, large jumps of
coefficients,  and special
kinds of elements that destroy the numerical relevance of  the 
underlying differential equations, such as side constraints on the
values of degrees of freedom,
enforced by large penalties ("stiff spring" or "contact" elements
in engineering parlance), or even arbitrary 
additional equations that are eliminated before the matrix is passed
to the solver ("multiple point constraints"). Such problems are hard
to solve by Algebraic Multigrid even if they are symmetric and positive semidefinite.
Without a-priori numerical estimates of the rate of convergence, with  a rigorous
foundation, an Algebraic Multigrid algorithm is essentially based just on the hope
that the problem will not have anything unexpected and things will work out in the end.
<p>
One common estimate that can be computed a-priori is the 
weak approximation property, which
bounds the error of the best approximation in Euclidean norm
of a fine grid vector by the prolongation of a coarse grid vector
in terms of the energy norm of the fine grid vector. The weak approximation property is known to
imply a bound on the two-level convergence factor, albeit a fairly
pessimistic one. In the smoothed aggregation method 
<a href="#Ref1">[1]</a>,
two-level as well as multilevel convergence
bounds can be obtained <a href="#Ref2">[2]</a> from the weak approximation property for the
so-called tentative prolongator, which is simply the transpose of the matrix of
a weighted aggregation of degrees of freedom. The actual
prolongation used in the multigrid algorithm is then obtained by smoothing
the tentative prolongation. 
<p>
In the absence of multiple point constraints, 
the constant in the weak approximation property can be bounded rigorously from the solution
of eigenvalue problems based on local element matrices.
In <a href="#Ref3">[3]</a>, it was proposed to 
select the columns of the tentative prolongator as the eigenvectors of the local problems
and to control the convergence of algebraic multigrid by choosing the number of the eigenvectors
 and by selecting the amount of smoothing of the prolongation.
<p>
In practice, the problem to be solved is most conveniently given in terms of a single
global stiffness matrix with all constraints incorporated. Then the information contained in the
local stiffness matrices is lost, and  
to bound the constant in the weak approximation property
rigorously by the solution of local eigenvalue problems, one would need 
to decompose the global matrix into the sum of
positive semidefinite local matrices. We show that in general, such decomposition does not exists
if the dimension of the coarse space is more than two. To estimate
the contribution of a single aggregate (or, equivalently, of a block of coarse basis functions)
to the constant in the weak approximation property, we decompose the global matrix into local
matrices corresponding to the decomposition
of the set of all nodes into the given aggregate and its complement. 
We also present further approximation techniques to reduce the cost of the estimation. 
The resulting estimates are not
rigorous but they are still practically useful.
<p>
We show that bad constants in the weak approximation condition will sometimes arize when the 
coarsening does not follow strong couplings of the nodes. An analysis of the mechanism how this happens 
shows when coarsening along weak couplings can still be tolerated. 
We observe that while strong couplings can be usually quite well determined from the local stiffness 
matrices, the computation of strong couplings from the global matrix is not reliable. 
We propose a new method to estimate the strength of the coupling between two nodes from 
an approximate local matrix corresponding to the pair of nodes.
