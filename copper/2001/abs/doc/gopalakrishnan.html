<p>

Time-harmonic Maxwell equations in a lossless cavity lead to a second
order differential equation for electric field involving a
differential operator that is neither elliptic nor definite.  A
Galerkin method using Nedelec's curl-conforming finite elements can be
employed to get approximate solutions numerically. In this talk,
results of [4, 5] on the suitability of multigrid and Schwarz methods
for efficiently solving the resulting indefinite linear system will be
presented.


<p>

The analysis of the present work builds on techniques in [1, 6] to
overcome the difficulties caused by the non-ellipticity of the
operator. As in their analysis, discrete Helmholtz decompositions play
a crucial role.  A new and critical ingredient of our analysis is an
estimate on discrete solution operators of Maxwell equations.  This
estimate allows analysis of overlapping Schwarz methods in the spirit
of perturbation arguments in [3], even though our operator is not
elliptic.  It also allows analysis of a `\' multigrid cycle
using techniques of [2], although prima facie it may appear that
ellipticity is required for application of these techniques. In both
cases, the analysis involves comparison of operators with their
analogues in positive definite case.

<p>

Of practical importance is the fact that some algorithms that work
well in the elliptic case, fails in our application. It has now been
known for some time that a multigrid V-cycle with a point-Jacobi
smoother is not appropriate for our problem.  However, we show that a
multigrid algorithm with block Jacobi or block Gauss-Seidel smoother,
if the blocks are chosen as in [1], leads to good convergence rates,
provided the coarse mesh used is sufficiently fine.  Our results also
indicate that, in contrast to the elliptic case, replacing subdomain
solves by equivalent operations in overlapping Schwarz methods does
not lead to good results.
