<p> 

There exists a variety of algebraic multigrid methods for elliptic
problems in Sobolev spaces. Recently, Arnold,Falk and Winther and
Hiptmair presented geometric multigrid methods for elliptic problems
in the spaces H(curl) and H(div). Their new multigrid components are
special smoothers, the grid transfer is canonical since the spaces are
nested. Their analysis is much more involved then the multigrid
estimates for problems in Sobolev spaces. The difficulty occurs since
the operator leads to a regularity pick-up only on a part of the
space. They overcome the difficulty by splitting the space due to the
discrete Helmholtz decomposition.  Heavily exploring the commuting
diagram property, they can approximate both components independently.

<p> 

In our talk we will present a technique to maintain the commuting
diagram property during an algebraic coarsening process. The key is to
identify the geometric entities node, edge and face, and keep
their relationships on the coarser levels. As usual, we can give a two
level analysis, and present a couple of numerical results
demonstrating the good multigrid behavior. The algorithm is
implemented into Stefan Reitzinger's AMG code
