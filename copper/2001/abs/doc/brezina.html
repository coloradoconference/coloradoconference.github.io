<p>
We have recently presented modified version of the smoothed aggregation 
multigrid suitable for application on problems featuring large variation of 
coefficients. For the modified version, we have been able to prove convergence 
independent of the size of the coefficient jump under certain assumptions 
on the jump distribution.  
<br>
However, numerical experiments suggest that our assumptions may be too 
restrictive and one may expect good convergence rates even 
in situations where our assumptions do not hold. 
In this talk, we present an extension of the convergence theory to certain 
configurations excluded by our theory to date.
