<p>
The diffusive component in many important application areas is
characterized by a discontinuous diffusion coefficient with fine-scale
anisotropic spatial structure; moreover, the underlying grid may be
severely distorted.  Thus, increasingly mixed discretizations, which
include mixed finite element methods (FEM) and support operator
methods (SOM), are employed because they explicitly enforce important
physical physical properties of the problem.  Unfortunately, these
discretizations are based on the first order form, and hence naturally
lead to an indefinite linear system.  In the case of orthogonal grids
and a diagonal diffusion tensor optimal preconditioners have been
developed.  However, the performance of these methods degrades with
increasing full tensor anisotropy or grid distortion.  Moreover, 
the development of alternative preconditioners that are robust
with respect to general forms of anisotropy has been thwarted by 
a significant loss of sparsity.

<p>In this work we are motivated by one specific advantage that the
hybrid or local forms of mixed discretizations exhibit, namely, their
more localized sparsity structure.  Specifically, for the SOM we
consider augmentation of the flux (i.e., vector unknowns) such that an
appropriate ordering of the augmented flux leads to a new block
diagonal system for this component.  In contrast to the block diagonal
structure of the hybrid system this system has blocks centered about
vertices, and block elimination of the flux (i.e., formation of the
Schur complement) leads to a symmetric positive definite scalar
problem with a standard cell-based 9-point structure (in two
dimensions).  This reduced system is readily solved with existing
robust multigrid methods, such as Dendy's black box multigrid.  An
analogous approach is used to augment the hybrid system and derive the
equivalent preconditioner for this case.  We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this preconditioner for both GMRES iterations of the
full indefinite system as well as a CG iterations of the reduced
scalar problem.
