<p>

In simulating time-varrying magnetic fields in electromagnetic devices like 
motors and transformers, it is often necessary to couple the partial
differential equation for the magnetic field with a model for the external 
electrical circuit connections. The electrical circuit is a system of 
linear equations relating the unknown currents and voltages of the 
electrical conductors present in the device to known voltage and current 
sources. Time-varrying sources give rise to magnetically induced currents 
and voltages in the conductors. The partial differential equation and the 
circuit are coupled by these magnetically induces quantities. 

<p> 

In low-frequent time-harmonic Maxwell formulations in two dimensions, 
the partial differential governing the magnetic vector potential is the 
Helmholtz equation with a complex shift. The finite element discretization 
of this equation results in sparse, complex symmetric system matrices. 
Discretized 
field-circuit coupled problems yield two by two block structured matrices 
whose diagonal is formed by the discretized partial differential equation 
and the electrical circuit matrix. The size of the second diagonal block is 
typically several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the first. The 
coupling is performed in such a way that no fill-in occurs in the discritized 
differential equation matrix and that the two by two block matrices are again 
complex symmetric.

Solving the linear system is the computational bottleneck in simulating 
technically relevant engineering problems. Motivated by previous experience 
[1,2],  
we want to alleviate this bottleneck by the application of algebraic multigrid 
(AMG) techniques. The straightforward application of AMG is hampered by the 
presence of the electrical circuit. We develloped a multigrid cycle that takes 
the circuit into account. 

<p>

Our multigrid technique is a generalization of a method by Hackbush for 
solving an elliptic problem augmented by an algebraic equation. We base the 
AMG setup on the differential equation block of the matrix. The electrical 
circuit is taking into account in the cycling phase. The resulting algorithm 
is a black-box solver for general field-circuit coupled problems. 

<p> 

For the implementation of our multigrid technique, we develloped an interface
between the GMD-AMG-code by Stueben and PETSc. This interace allows to call 
the AMG setup on the differential equation block of the system matrix. After 
the setup, the AMG coarser grid and interpolation operators are available as 
PETSc matrices. The multigrid cycling is done by PETSc's multigrid components 
that we extended to be able to treat the electrical circuit. 

<p> 

Our algorithm has been tested on a variety of engineering problems. It has 
proven to be stable and to deliver a speedup by a factor between five and ten 
compared to previously existing solvers.
