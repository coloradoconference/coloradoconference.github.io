<p>
The constrained transport (CT) algorithm introduced by Evans and Hawley
(1988) on structured meshes provides a mechanism for advection of magnetic
flux density which also preserves a discrete div(B)=0 property. CT is
extended to unstructured meshes and algorithms for computing high-order
upwind fluxes on edges are compared. The natural association of edge and
face elements with CT on unstructured meshes is discussed.
