<br>Abstract
</center>

<p> 
In this talk I will consider approximations to second order elliptic
problems on non-matching grids which utilize penalty terms to
impose interface continuity.  This approach avoids the introduction and
construction of multiplier subspaces commonly associated with mortar
finite element techniques.
I will present results which
show that in the case of piecewise linear finite elements,
the penalty formulation leads to almost optimal approximation.
