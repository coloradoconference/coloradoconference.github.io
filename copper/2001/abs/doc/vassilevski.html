<p>
In this talk we will present a natural domain decomposition strategy for parallelizing agglomeration based AMGe (algebraic multigrid for finite element
problems exploiting fine-grid element matrices). 

<p>
The method consists of the following simple steps: 
<br>

    (1)   local subdomain solvers (preconditioners); i.e., each mesh subdomain (union of fine grid elements) is assigned to a processor and a sequential
       AMGe solver is built in there. That is, a sequence of coarse grids (coarse spaces) and respective interpolation matrices are constructed. The
       setup phase is based on the local bilinear (quadratic) forms (assembled from the subdomain element matrices). Since the local bilinear forms, in
       the case of model Laplace operator, correspond to a problem with natural (Neumann type) boundary conditions they are typically only
       semi-definite. Therefore, one builds the sequential AMGe solvers to be defined only for vectors in a space which is a hierarchical complement to a
       certain coarse space. This coarse space must contain the null-space components (so called rigid body modes) of the local quadratic forms. The
       version of the AMGe method which we exploit, called spectral agglomerate AMGe, allows for explicit construction of such hierarchical
       complements and ensures that the null-space components are fully represented on the coarse grid. 


<p>
   (2)    a global coarse problem; 
<p>
<p>
The overall preconditioner then is defined as the standard Neumann-Neumann type domain decomposition preconditioner (cf., [3], [2] or [4]), however,
here the preconditioner is defined not for the interface Schur complements (as is in the original Neumann-Neumann case) but is applied to the original
bilinear forms. As already mentioned, in addition to the subdomain solvers, one incorporates a global coarse solver. 
<p>
<p>
The sequential subdomain coarsening AMGe algorithm consists of an agglomeration step and involves computing a few minimal eigenvectors of the
corresponding assembled agglomerate stiffness matrix. The method (similarly to [1] and [5]) requires access to the individual element matrices (in order
to assemble certain subdomain matrices). Based on the topological agglomeration algorithm (cf. [5]) we employed and the special interpolation rule
chosen, one is able to define coarse elements and coarse element matrices thus allowing for recursion. 
<p>
<p>
Numerical tests illustrating the parallel performance of the algorithm will be presented.
