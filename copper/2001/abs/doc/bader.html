<p>
We present a multigrid method that is based on the combination of 
recursive substructuring of the computational domain and the 
discretisation on hierarchical bases and generating systems. 
The substructuring approach makes the algorithm inherently parallel. 
The use of hierarchical generating systems allows an optimal complexity 
of the resulting method.  
The robustness of the resulting method for convection problems is 
achieved by a partial elimination between certain "coarse grid unknowns".
<p>
This additional elimination is performed such that in the resulting 
matrices of the local systems of equations any couplings between coarse 
grid unknowns on the separator and coarse grid unknowns on the subdomain 
boundary are zero. 
The coarse grid unknowns themselves are chosen with respect to the 
physical properties of the underlying differential equation. 
<p>
The resulting coarse grid meshes are not uniformly coarsened but are 
refined on the edges and separators of the coarse grid cells. 
This refinement of the coarse grid unknowns is chosen such that the 
number of coarse grid unknowns grows with the square root of the total 
number of boundary and separator unknowns. 
This choice is due to the fact that for convection diffusion problems 
the isolines of the transported matter are typically parabolic. 
<p>
We will present some results for the application of this method to several 
convection diffusion problems. 
For these benchmark problems the algorithm shows an O(N) complexity with 
respect to the required computing time and storage. 
In particular, the number of iterations needed does not depend on the 
geometry of the flow field. 
Moreover it is also independent of the strength of convection as long 
as a certain amount of diffusion is present. 
More precisely, it requires that on the finest grid a certain mesh Peclet 
number is not exceeded. 
<p>
The algorithm can also be applied to convection problems on complicated 
computational domains with reasonably complex boundaries and obstacles. 
It is especially suited to discretisation techniques that are based on 
a quadtree or octree representation of the computational domain.
