<br>Abstract
</center>
 
<p>
Over the years, there have been many variants and different approaches
to algebraic multigrid methods. In this talk, we attempt to describe
and classify a number of these. This is not meant to be all-inclusive,
but is a start of a framework for classification and comparison of
AMG variants, both new and old.
