<p>
This talk is about multilevel techniques for solving a nonlinear
problem f(u) = 0 ! in a Hilbert space H, arising from a least squares
formulation
for a system of nonlinear partial differential equations
of first order.
After discretizing the space H, this is a minimization problem that may
be solved using a linear multilevel method for successive Gauss-Newton
problems or using a nonlinear multilevel method like FAS.
<p>
Although these approaches both yield nice numerical results, there are
some difficulties in the convergence theory.
Since the discretized problem is not consistent, the core problem turns
from finding a zero of f(u)
to finding a zero of df/du which requires second order information about
f for the theory.
One more problem for describing theory for the linear multilevel case is
the lack
of a direct relation between the error due to the discretization
and the algebraical error due to the iterative method in order to check
on overall convergence.
For the FAS-case, the Gauss-Newton method does not fit into existing
nonlinear multilevel theory with respect
to smoothing properties.
<p>
These problems disappear if the (inexact) Gauss-Newton solver is applied
directly to the infinite
dimensional problem in H and the emerging linear problems are
discretized and solved
using linear multilevel after that.
The problem remains consistent and the above-mentioned errors both
contribute to
the inaccuracy of the Gauss-Newton method.
Consequently, the number of linear multilevel sweeps may be monitored by
easily computable
error bounds via the multiplicative multilevel norm ensuring convergence
of the overall method.
<p>
In this talk, these results will be presented in more detail. Numerical
examples show the competitiveness of this method.
