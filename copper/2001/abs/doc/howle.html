<p>
We consider the use of parallel block preconditioning techniques
for the Navier-Stokes equations.  These block techniques correspond
to those of Kay & Loghin and result in methods that can be effective
and robust over a variety of Reynolds numbers. The basic idea is to
approximate the Schur complement operator for the Pressure equation
based on the notion that certain differential operators approximately
commute. The resulting preconditioner requires two block `solves' at each
invocation: one for the pressure unknowns and the other for the velocities.
A multigrid V cycle is then used to approximate each of these block solves,
which makes the cost per iteration proportional to the number of unknowns.
Numerical studies on the ASCI Red machine demonstrate that the preconditioner
is effective in terms of both convergence rate and parallel performance.
