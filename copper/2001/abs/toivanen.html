By embedding the original elliptic boundary value problem into a larger
simple-shaped domain and treating the Dirichlet boundary conditions by
using boundary Lagrange multipliers, the discretization and efficient
solution can become much easier. The generation of hierarchical meshes
required by the traditional multigrid methods for complicated domains
can be very difficult or even impossible. Furthermore, it much easier
to make fast cache aware multigrid implementations for simple-shaped
domains like rectangles. The use of Lagrange multipliers leads to
saddle-point problems which are here assumed to be symmetric.
Such problems can be solved using a preconditioned MINRES method.
A simple and natural idea is to construct separate preconditioners
for primal variables and Lagrange multipliers. Thus, the overall
preconditioner has a block diagonal form. The preconditioner for
the primal variables can be based on any symmetric multigrid method or,
for example, on fast direct solvers. It is well-known that a good
preconditioner for the Lagrange multipliers should approximate the
Schur complement of the diagonal block for primal variables in
the saddle-point matrix. One family of such preconditioners are based
on the square root of a boundary operator, but they are not robust with
respect to the geometry of domain. Furthermore, usual implementations
based on FFT can not be used for three-dimensional problems.

Here, preconditioners for Lagrange multipliers based on multilevel
techniques for Poisson-like problems are proposed. More precisely, the
employed techniques are the multilevel nodal basis (BPX) and multilevel
diagonal scaling (MDS) preconditioners. The idea is to approximate
the Schur complement using these techniques and then perform the
multiplication by its inverse by using a suitable iterative method.
The implementation must take an advantage of sparsity of vectors
in the different levels of multilevel preconditioners in order to be
affordable. To implement such a sparse version of BPX or MDS might seem
to be difficult, but in practice it is rather easy and straightforward task.
A natural assumption is that the number of Lagrange multipliers is the
order of square root of N for two-dimensional problems and the order of
square of cubic root of N for three-dimensional problems, where N denotes
the number of primal variables. In this case, a simple analysis shows
that the computational cost of approximating the Schur complement using
BPX or MDS requires the same order of floating point operations as
the number of Lagrange multipliers is. Furthermore, based on a simple
condition number estimation it can be shown that the number of CG or
Chebyshev iterations required to perform a multiplication by the inverse
of the Schur complement approximation is the order of square root of N
for two-dimensional problems and the order of cubic root of N for
three-dimensional problems. Thus, the total computational cost of
applying Lagrange preconditioner once is the order of N.

In the numerical experiments, the efficiency of proposed approach
is studied for two-dimensional and three-dimensional Poisson and diffusion
problems. The number of iterations and the condition number for several
problems are given. Also, the capability to solve easily problems in very
complicated domains is demonstrated.
