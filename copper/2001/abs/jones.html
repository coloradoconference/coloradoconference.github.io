<p>
Our discussion concerns the application of nonlinear multigrid, 
or FAS, to nonlinear diffusion problems with the eventual target 
application of variably saturated flow.  We will focus on 
computational issues related to calculation of efficient 
interpolation and restriction operators for the multigrid 
V-cycle, as well as appropriate nonlinear coarse grid operators. 
Our numerical results compare this nonlinear multigrid method 
with traditional Newton techniques.
