<p>

Implicit discretization of time dependent problems
in computational physics, semiconductor device simulation,
electromigration and
fluid dynamics often gives rise to elliptic equations.
Helmholtz type equations usually appear in acoustics
or electromagnetics and also as a result of time discretization of
the Navier-Stokes equations. 
Biharmonic problems appear in elasticity and viscous flows.
<p>
We solve the Helmholtz and the biharmonic equation by the Domain
Decomposition (DD) methods.
Previously [1] we adopted a DD method where the equation was solved in
each subdomain with assumed boundary conditions,
resulting in jumps in function or derivative on subdomain boundaries.
These jumps were removed by the introduction of singularity layers.
In order to account for the global effect of the layers we computed
first the influence of each layer on each subdomain boundary,
taking into account the decay or smoothing out of the influence
as a function of the distance from the layer.
To reduce the communication load,  compression in a multiwavelet
basis was applied.
Nevertheless, this part of the  procedure can  become expensive
as the number of subdomains grows considerably.
An  algorithm for a fast solution of the Poisson equation
by decomposition of the domain into square domains and the subsequent
matching of these solutions by the fast multipole method was
developed in [2].
<p>
The algorithm developed in [1] incorporates the following steps:
<br>
1. In each subdomain
a particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation
with arbitrary Neumann (Dirichlet) boundary conditions is found.
<br>
2. The collection of particular solutions usually has
discontinuities (or discontinuities in the derivatives) on the
boundaries of the subdomains. We introduce double (single) layers on the
boundaries to match
the solutions from different domains to have continuous global solution.
The effect of these layers on other boundaries is calculated.
<br>
3. The solutions obtained at the first step are patched
by adding the solutions of the Laplace
equation with the boundary conditions that were computed in the previous
step.
<br>
4. An additional solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation is
added to satisfy the global boundary conditions.
<p>

Considerable improvement in the efficiency of 
the interface jump removal step can be achieved if at each step only
adjacent boxes are matched. This is the basis of the hierarchical
approach which was proposed in [4].
The "elementary step" of the hierarchical algorithm is the following.
<br>
1. First, for each two adjacent subdomains some boundary conditions
are defined.
These conditions should not contradict the given right hand side
at the junctions (see [4]).
The Poisson equation is solved with these boundary
conditions by a fast spectral algorithm [3].
<br>  
2. The solutions have a discontinuity in the first derivative.
We match the subdomains by adding certain discontinuous
functions. In fact we only evaluate these functions at the boundaries
of two adjacent subdomains and then
solve the homogeneous equation in each subdomain with the cumulative
boundary conditions.
<br>  
3. The global homogeneous equation is solved in such a way that
it satisfies
the assumed conditions at the ``global boundaries" of the merged
subdomains.
The solution of the non-homogeneous equation is expensive 
if compared to the homogeneous equation where efficient algorithms
are available [3].
<br>
This step is repeated hierarchically.
For example, first the smallest adjacent domains are matched:
box 1 with box 2, box 3 with box 4, then the merged box 1,2 is
matched with 3,4, afterwards the box which is a union of boxes 1,2,3,4
is patched with the adjacent merged box etc.
<p>
Here we extend the results of [1,4] in the following directions.
<p>
1. In addition to the Poisson equation, we solve 
the Helmholtz or modified Helmholtz equation.
One of the problems that arise is
resonance and non-resonance situations
for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
This can be avoided by introducing
"transparent" boundary conditions which are
approximations to the Sommerfeld radiation
boundary condition.
This means that the scattered wave behaves 
asymptotically like a diverging spherical wave. Some modifications
of the non-reflecting conditions were considered in [5]. 
<p>
2. We solve the biharmonic equation with either a free boundary
as in [2] or
boundary conditions of one type only
(Dirichlet or Neumann).
The biharmonic equation is split into a coupled system of 
the Poisson equations. The unknown function satisfies the Poisson equation
with a certain right hand side which will be called a vorticity
function. 
 The solution  is also performed by DD. 
Here the matching algorithm which was developed in [1,4]
is applied to find the smooth vorticity function which matches
the given right hand side. Then we obtain a solution of the
biharmonic equation. The global boundary conditions of either 
Dirichlet or Neumann
type can be satisfied by the addition of an appropriate
harmonic function, as was done for the solution of the Poisson equation.
