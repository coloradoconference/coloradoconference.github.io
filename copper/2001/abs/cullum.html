<p>
Algebraic multigrid <i>(AMG)</i> methods for
solving large systems of linear equations, <i>Ax=b</i>,
are  matrix-based analogs of geometric 
multigrid methods. 
Both types of methods are multi-level, 
with the method being applied recursively
at each level except at the bottom level.

<p>
In this talk we 
focus on <i>AMG</i> procedures which are
based upon papers of Ruge and St&uuml;ben.
At each level, except the bottom level,
the procedure requires the choice of the
<ol> 
<li> <i>Coarse</i> and <i>Fine</i> variables </li>
<li> <i>Prolongation</i> and  <i>Restriction</i> operators</li>
<li> <i> Coarse</i> problem </li>
<li> <i>Smoother</i> operator </li>
</ol> 

The choice of each of these components
places constraints upon the choice of each of
the other components. 
Numerically, we explore the effects of 
different choices upon the observed convergence.
We consider example problems where <i>AMG</i>
has been shown to work well and other example
problems where  <i>AMG</i> converges
slowly.
