<p>
Finite element are relatively uncommon for basin scale simulations of
the oceanic circulation. Here, we present the spectral element ocean
model, SEOM, an h-p type FEM model that solves the Boussinesq
hydrostatic primitive equations. The model exist in two versions that
differ primarily in their choice of vertical coordinate system: a
"sigma"-like terrain-following coordinate system, and a density
(isopycnal) coordinate. We discuss briefly the pro's and cons of each
version and present a calculation of the wind-driven circulation over
the Pacific Basin using the isopycnal model.
