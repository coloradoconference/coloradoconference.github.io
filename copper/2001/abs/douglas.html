We simulate the wind driven circulation in oceans.  Our aim is to study the
impact of short scale wind forcing on the oceanic circulation.  We use the
isopycnal version of the Spectral Element Ocean Model (SEOM).  The modeling of
these flows and their climatic impact is complicated by the inherent range of
spatial scales involved, which extend from the global scale of O(10,000) km
down to the local scale of O(1) km, and by the intrinsic three dimensionality
of the dynamics.
<p>
SEOM offers an elegant solution to these difficulties.  It features advanced
algorithms, based on h-p type finite element methods, allowing accurate
representation of complex coastline and oceanic bathymetry, variable lateral
resolution, and high order solution of the three dimensional oceanic equations
of motion.

SEOM's geometrical flexibility permits highly inhomogeneous horizontal grids.
An added advantage of the technique is its scalability.  Most of the
computations are carried out at the element level; only interface information
needs to be exchanged between elements.  The dual characteristic of dense and
structured local computations, and sparse and unstructured communication
enhances the locality of the computations.  The dual characteristic of dense
and structured local computations, and sparse and unstructured communication
enhances the locality of the computations, and makes SEOM ideally suited for
parallel computers.
<p>
In this talk, we define a novel set of techniques that allow us to store
relevant matrices for 1/200-th the normal amount that would be expected using
normal sparse matrix techniques.  A combination of a Schur complement and a
parallel algebraic multigrid method is described and compared to a traditional
matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient solution methodolgy.
