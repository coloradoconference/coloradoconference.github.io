<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
We consider the use of parallel algebraic multigrid for the solution 
of Maxwell's equations which are discretized via edge elements.
The key difficulty is properly mapping the Curl operator's null space on to the 
coarse grids via a prolongation operator that is constructed using only 
algebraic information (i.e. matrix coefficients and a minimal amount of 
element information).
The scheme that we consider is based on the work of 
Reitzinger and Sch&ouml;berl as well as that of Hiptmair.
This parallel multilevel 
preconditioner is implemented within the ML framework which already contains 
similar techniques like smoothed aggregation.
The resulting iteration scheme is being integrated into a large complex
parallel code that requires the repeated solution of the eddy current
approximation to Maxwell's 
equations in a heterogeneous material properties environment as part of an 
overall Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian magnetohydrodynamics algorithm. 
Numerical experiments are presented illustrating the efficiency of the 
approach on the ASCI Red machine in terms of both convergence and parallel 
speed-up.
