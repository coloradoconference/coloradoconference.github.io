<p>
A brief account of new multiscale computational approaches in
the following areas: efficient algebraic multigrid, Dirac solvers, 
image processing, clustering, tomography, inverse hyperbolic problems,
optimal control, collective computation of many eigenfunctions,
global optimization, statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics.
A full account of these and other developments, with detailed 
reference list, will appear in the Proceeding of the Yosemite
Educational Symposium (Springer Series Lecture Notes in Computational
Science and Engineering) and on the Internet at the time of the
Copper Mountain Conference.
