<p>
Recently a new general algorithm, denoted "element-free AMGe," was
proposed [1], for constructing the interpolation weights in algebraic
multigrid.  The method uses an extension mapping to provide boundary
values outside a neighborhood about a fine-grid degree of freedom
(dof) to which interpolation is desired. The interpolated value is
obtained by a matrix-dependent harmonic extension of these boundary
values into the interior of the neighborhood. In essence, this method
is designed to capture information that can be obtained from
individual finite-element stiffness matrices, as is done in the
so-called "element-based AMG method" (AMGe) [2], for problems in which
such matrices may not be available.
<p>
The object of such a method is to characterize, on a local scale, the
nature of the smooth modes of the global operator, insuring that they
can be represented by the interpolation. We propose here a
modification to this method, in which we use a more global method of
localizing the nature of the smooth modes. In essence, the "extended
neighborhood" of the fine-grid dof is defined globally, by looking at
the coarse dofs on every level that feed information to the specified
fine dof.  The harmonic extension is then generated from a
"multilevel" extended neighborhood, which can be constructed to allow
for recursive improvement of the interpolation operators as each
coarser level is addressed.
<p>
We describe the basic algorithm and methods of implementation, and
discuss some early experimental results.
