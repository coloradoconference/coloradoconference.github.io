Full multigrid (FMG) algorithms are the fastest solvers for elliptic problems. 
These algorithms can solve a general discretized elliptic problem 
to the discretization accuracy in a computational work  that is a small
(less than 10) multiple of the operation count in one target-grid residual 
evaluation. Such efficiency is known as textbook multigrid efficiency 
(TME). The difficulties associated with extending 
TME for solution of the Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations relate to the fact that the  
RANS equations are a system of coupled nonlinear equations
that is not, even for subsonic Mach numbers, fully elliptic, but
contain hyperbolic partitions. TME for the RANS simulations 
can be achieved if the different factors contributing to 
the system could be separated and treated
optimally, e.g., by multigrid for elliptic factors
and by downstream marching for hyperbolic factors.
One of the ways to separate the factors is the <it> distributed 
relaxation </it> approach proposed by A. Brandt.
Earlier demonstrations of TME solvers with
distributed relaxation has been performed for
the incompressible free-stream inviscid and viscous
flows without boundary layers.

In this talk, I am going to outline a general framework
for achieving TME in solution of the  high-Reynolds-number Navier-Stokes 
equations. TME distributed-relaxation solvers will be demonstrated for 
the viscous incompressible and subsonic compressible flows with boundary layers 
and for the inviscid compressible flow with shock.
