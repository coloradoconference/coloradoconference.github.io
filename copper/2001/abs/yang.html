<br>Abstract
</center>
<p>

The need to solve increasingly larger linear systems, with hundreds of 
millions or billions of unknowns, has necessitated the use of massively 
parallel computers and the investigation of scalable linear solvers, such as
multigrid. For unstructured grid problems, an attractive choice is
algebraic multigrid (AMG). Although AMG is a very effective method for 
many applications, however for some applications, e.g. structural elasticity 
problems where the governing equations are a system of PDEs with the unknowns 
being the displacements in each coordinate direction, the choice of 
conventional smoothers such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel within AMG is not 
sufficient to achieve good convergence.
<p>

In this talk, we investigate the use of the Schwarz alternating method as a 
smoother on the finest levels of AMG. Preliminary experiments show promising 
results for such problems as mentioned above. We consider both multiplicative 
and additive variants of the Schwarz method. The use of a multicoloring 
technique for parallelization of the multiplicative variant is considered.
The choice of domains, efficiency and convergence behavior are discussed, 
and numerical results are presented.
