<P>Multigrid is a popular solution method for the set of linear algebraic
equations that arise from PDEs discretized with the finite element method.
The application of multigrid to unstructured grid problems, however, is
not well developed. We discuss a method that uses many of the same techniques
as the finite element method itself, to apply standard multigrid algorithms
to unstructured finite element problems. We use maximal independent sets
(MISs), like many "algebraic" multigrid methods, as a heuristic to 
automatically
coarsen unstructured grids. The inherent flexibility in the selection of
an MIS allows for the use of heuristics to improve their effectiveness
for a multigrid solver. We present heuristics and algorithms to optimize
the quality of MISs, and the meshes constructed from them, for use in multigrid
solvers for unstructured problems in solid mechanics . We show that our
solver, and parallel finite element architecture, does indeed scale well,
with test problems in 3D large deformation elasticity and plasticity, with
over 26 million degrees of freedom on a 640 processor Cray T3E (with 55\%
parallel efficiency), and on 84 IBM 4-way SMP PowerPC nodes.

<P>This work is motivated by the success of the finite element method in
simulating complex physical systems in science and engineering, coupled
with the wide spread availability of ever more powerful computers, which
has lead to the need for efficient equation solvers for implicit finite
element applications.&nbsp; Finite element matrices are often poorly 
conditioned
- this fact has made the use of direct solvers popular as they are relatively
unaffected by the condition number of the matrix.&nbsp; As the scale of
the problems increase, direct methods, however, possess sub-optimal time
and space complexity when compared to iterative methods.&nbsp; Also, as
larger and faster computers are becoming more widely available, to a larger
number of research institutions and industries, the use of iterative methods
will become increasingly more necessary.&nbsp; Thus, given the computational
resources available today, and those that are continually being introduced,
direct methods are inefficient in solving large problems - resulting in
the need to resort to iterative methods.
<P>Many iterative methods are notoriously unreliable on finite element
problems of interest.&nbsp; Multigrid is one of a family of highly optimal
multilevel domain decomposition methods, and is known to be a highly effective
method to solve finite element matrices.&nbsp; The application of multigrid
techniques to unstructured meshes, that are the hallmark of the finite
element method, has not been well developed, and is currently an active
area of research.&nbsp; In particular, the development of practical multigrid
methods for unstructured finite element problems, of arbitrary geometric
complexity and size, is an open problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper discusses
methods for the effective application of classical multigrid methods in
the solution of the large sparse system of equations that arise from 
unstructured
finite element problems in 3D large deformation elasticity and elasticity.
<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P>We build on an algorithm first proposed by Guillard (1992) and independently
by Chan and Smith (1994).&nbsp; The purpose, of this algorithm, is to 
automatically
construct a coarse grid, from a finer grid, for use in standard multigrid
algorithms.&nbsp; This method is applied recursively to produce a series
of coarse grids, and their attendant operators, from a "fine" (application
provided) grid.&nbsp; A high level view of the algorithm is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
The vertex set at the current level (the "fine" mesh) is evenly coarsened,
using an maximal independent set (MIS) algorithm to produce a much smaller
subset of vertices.</LI>

<LI>
The new vertex set is then automatically remeshed with tetrahedra.</LI>

<LI>
The new vertex set is then automatically remeshed with tetrahedra.</LI>

<LI>
The restriction operator is then used to construct the (Galerkin) coarse
grid operator from the fine grid operator, i.e. A<SUB>coarse</SUB> &lt;-
RA<SUB>fine</SUB>R<SUP>T</SUP>.</LI>
</UL>
Our work centers on articulating these algorithms to optimize performance,
of this method, on large scale problems in solid mechanics - though our
methods are very general as they strive to optimize the geometric 
representation
of the coarse grids, and all PDEs discretized with the finite element methods
have geometry.
<P>To motivate our approach, we first state the general purpose of the
coarse grids in multigrid algorithms: the goal of the coarse grid function
spaces is to approximate the low frequency part of the spectrum of the
current grid.&nbsp; Each successive grid's function space should (with
a drastically reduced vertex set) approximate, as best as it can, the lowest
frequencies (or eigen functions) of the previous grid.&nbsp; That is, with
say 10\% of the vertices from the fine grid, it is natural to expect that
one could only represent the lowest 10\% of the fine grid spectra well.&nbsp;
It is not possible to satisfy this criterion directly (on unstructured
grids), but a natural heuristic is to represent the geometry as well as
possible.&nbsp; With a good representation of the geometry (implicitly
assumed on structured grid problems) one can hope that the finite element
function spaces, of the coarse grids, will approximate the lowest modes
of the fine grid well.
<P>Thus, our basic approach is to construct a low order geometric 
representation
of the "fine", or current grid, with a "coarse" grid; and recursively apply
this process; use standard finite element function spaces; and use this
series of function spaces in one of many standard multigrid algorithms.&nbsp;

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
ALE3D is a high resolution multi-physics code being developed 
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for
the DOE's ASCI program. The multi-physics nature of the code necessitates
an implicit mechanical modeling capability (in addition to the explicit 
capability) due to the often disparate
timescales involved in a single simulation. 
High resolution implicit mechanics simulations 
can lead to extremely
difficult linear systems. The resulting matrices 
are often large, indefinite,
very ill-conditioned, and pose a significant
challenge to most iterative solvers so that even the task
of selecting an efficient smoother can be problematic. 
<p>
In order to succesfully
run the high resolution simulations required by the ASCI program,
the linear solver algorithms employed by the ALE3D code must be scalable
and very efficient on MPP platforms. 
In this talk, we describe
the ALE3D implicit hydrodynamics package. We will highlight the 
physical and algebraic properties that lead to difficulties in the linear
systems. Additionally, we will discuss current techniques being used to
produce scalable solutions to these systems on MPP platforms.

Many applications in diverse areas such as geophysical

We consider a multilevel approach for the solution of
such problems where the sought parameter function
is gradually and adaptively refined. 
A complementary relationship with Tikhonov regularization
is exploited as well.
The method is applied to real world examples, and

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
A FOSLS formulation of the three-dimensional neutron transport equation, 
along with a Pn approximation in angle, creates a grad-div like system
for the first-order moments that standard multigrid solvers do not suitably 
handle.  Since we desire to use multilevel ideas as a solution method for 
all of the moments, we must resolve this issue.

<p>
First, we present how this grad-div system arises from our FOSLS 
formulation of the neutron transport equation.  We will then discuss a
relaxation scheme to augment our standard multigrid algorithm and    
possibly discuss some results for a two-dimensional version of the system.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>

In contrast to geometric multigrid methods the "classical" AMG
algorithms 
select the coarse grids dynamically during the setup phase.
This makes the parallelization of AMG algorithms a difficult task.
The parallelization is further complicated by the fact that
decompositions
of the fine grid may not be compatible with the coarse grid
decompositions.
<br>
A possible remedy would be to restrict the coarse grid selection to 
using structured grids but still to choose the prolongation and 
restriction operators depending on the matrix.
The nested dissection method offers strategies that lead to a
hierarchy of coarse grids that enables an efficient parallelization.
The drawbacks of this method, when applied as a direct solver, are the
increased requirements in storage and computation time.
<br>
However, the nested dissection method can be turned into an iterative 
solver by removing the weak couplings in the arising matrices.
Similar to AMG methods this can be done in a purely algebraic manner.
For example in the case of convection dominated flows, the coarse grid 
variables only depend on few upstream variables. 
When using hierarchical bases the number of the required upstream 
variables can be kept small enough to yield an algorithm of a complexity 
that is linear in the number of unknowns but retains a fast, 
multigrid-like convergence rate.

<p>
We present a FOSLS approach to the diffusion equation with discontinuous
coefficients. In certain geometric situations the flow field naturally 
exhibits singularities. To cope with this behavior we add singular basis 
functions to a standard finite element space (e.g. linears on triangles). 
This is done in such a way that inner products of standard basis functions 
with the singular basis functions only have to be calculated in a small 
fringe region of minimal width that surrounds the point where a singularity 
in the flow field occurs. We introduce a multigrid method for this problem 
that incorporates singular basis functions on all levels of the hierarchy 
of grids.

<p>
We will present a black-box multilevel iterative solver based on the 
idea of the smoothed aggregation. The target applications 
are second order elliptic equations, with focus on problems of linear 
elasticity. 
The method is of an algebraic domain decomposition class.  
No knowledge of partitioning of the physical domain into subdomains 
is required as input. Instead, the decomposition of the algebraic problem 
into subproblems is generated by the solver at run time.  

<p>
Current convergence theory covers elliptic problems 
discretized on unstructured quasiuniform meshes, 
and the resulting convergence factor is independent of 
both the fine-level discretization parameter 
<i>h </i> and the characteristic coarse level parameter 
<i>H </i>.   

<p>
Efficiency of the method will be demonstrated by numerical experiments
including second order elliptic problems and singular perturbations thereof, 
as well as coupled elliptic systems and certain non-elliptic problems.

<br>ABSTRACT

<p>
In this talk, we introduce two least-squares approaches
for the solution of the Stokes 
equations perturbed by a Laplacian term. (Such perturbed Stokes equations
arise from finite element approximations of the Reissner-Mindlin 
plate.) Both are two-stage algorithms that first solve for the curls of
the rotation of the fibers and the solenoidal part of the shear strain,
then for the rotation itself (if desired). One approach uses $L^2$ norms
and the other approach $H^{-1}$ norms to define the least-squares
functionals.
Both admit optimal performance for standard finite element discretization
and either standard multigrid solution methods or preconditioners.
These methods do not degrade when the perturbed parameter (the plate
thickness) approaches zero. 
We also introduce a three-stage least-squares method for the 
Reissner-Mindlin plate, which first solve for the curls of the rotation
and the shear strain, next for the rotation itself, and then for the 
transverse displacement.

AMGe is an algebraic multigrid method for solving discretizations that

local representations
of algebraically "smooth" error components.  This measure and the

The Application of the Multigrid Method in a Nonhydrostatic 
Atmospheric Model
</center>

<p>

<p>
<center>
<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
A nonhydrostatic atmospheric model has been developed. This fully 
compressible three-dimensional model is governed by the Navier-Stokes 
equations. The use of the semi-implicit scheme (Tapp and White 1976) 
in this model has relaxed the constraint of exceedingly small time 
step. In the semi-implicit scheme, the low frequency waves are solved 
explicitly while the high frequency ones are solved implicitly. As a 
result of applying implicit scheme, an Elliptic Partial Differential 
Equation (EPDE) of pressure perturbation is generated.  For high 
resolution nonhydrostatic models, a huge sparse matrix 
(~400,000 x 400,000) of the EPDEs has to be solved. This study attempts 
to apply the Multigrid method to solve these EPDEs and to address the 
performance and efficiency of the Multigrid method. 

<p>
The Multigrid solver (mud3cr), developed by Adams (1998), is applied 
in this study.  This solver is available on the World Wide Web at 
http://www.scd.ucar.edu/css/software/mudpack.  It can be used 
to solve three-dimensional linear non-separable EPDEs with 
cross-derivative terms.  Many options are provided in this package: 
(1) imposed, periodic, or oblique mixed derivative boundary conditions;
(2) point-by-point or line-by-line relaxation; 
(3) V- or W-cycle relaxation.

<p>
In order to compare the model results with the analytical solution
and other existing numerical results, only two-dimensional experiments
are presented.  A thermal bubble (Robert 1993) and linear mountain 
waves (Queney 1948) are tested. In both experiments, one V-cycle per 
outer iteration and z-line relaxation are chosen in the Multigrid 
solver and the error tolerance is set to 0.01. The top boundary and 
lateral boundaries in the x direction are imposed, whereas the lower 
boundary is mixed.  

<p>
In the thermal bubble simulation, no terrain is involved (i.e., no 
cross-derivative terms) and the atmosphere is calm and isentropic. 
All parameters are assumed homogeneous in the y direction in this 
experiment, as well as the linear mountain wave experiment. There are 
321, 9 and 513 points in the x, y, and sigma directions, respectively. 
Sigma is a terrain-following coordinate and its value is 1 at the 
surface and 0 at the model top. Horizontal resolution is 5 m, vertical 
resolution is 1/192, and time interval is 1 second. The surface pressure 
is 1000 mb and potential temperature is 303 K (isentropic). Initially, 
a thermal bubble, which has the maximum value of 0.5 K, is placed at 
lower center of the domain. The model integrates for 18 minutes. 

<p>
For the linear mountain wave simulation, a bell-shaped ridge is imposed 
at the center of the domain. The crest of the ridge is 10 m and the 
half-width length is 1000 m. A uniform horizontal mean velocity 
(10 m/s) is applied to the whole atmosphere. A 30-band sponge zone is 
used at both x lateral boundaries and top boundary in this experiment 
to reduce the reflection of waves.  There are 385, 9 and 193 points 
in the x, y and sigma directions with uniform resolutions of 200 m 
in horizontal and 1/192 in vertical. Time step, sea level pressure 
and surface temperature are 10 seconds, 1000 mb and 300 K, respectively.  
The model integrates for 10 hours, at which time the solution 
approximately reaches steady state.

<p>
The simulation results of the thermal bubble experiment are quite
comparable with those in Robert (1993), and the simulation results of
the linear mountain waves are in good agreement with the analytical 
solution.  Furthermore, the Multigrid solver (mud3cr) applied in this 
model is very efficient in both cases.  It only takes 2 to 3 V-cycle 
iterations to converge for each time step.  Due to the use of the 
semi-implicit scheme, the time step used here is two orders greater 
than that allowed for explicit schemes.  Therefore, the total CPU time 
is still at least one order smaller than those of explicit schemes.  
These indicate the success of the Multigrid method applied to 
atmospheric nonhydrostatic models.

Our aim is to develop a robust and efficient method for numerical
simulation of steady-state problems that model interaction between fluid
flow and elastic structures.  Our focus is on flow of the aqueous humor
around the iris in the eye.  Since our research involves developing a new
first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) approach, we begin with a much
simpler problem - the 'square eye'. The FOSLS approach has been used to
derive one all-encompassing functional that incorporates both the
structural and the fluid flow systems, as well as a new form of elliptic
grid generation used to transform the changing fluid region to a fixed
computational domain.  This combined elasticity-fluid-EGG functional
allows us to represent the whole problem as a single minimization
principle on a fixed domain. Our initial attempts to minimise this
nonlinear functional will be based on Newton's method and algebraic
multigrid (AMG). This talk will outline the basic FOSLS approach and
describe our progress to date.

<p>

Mixed discretizations for the solution of the diffusion equation,
which are based on the first-order form, are currently popular because
they rigorously enforce important physical properties, such as mass
balance and continuity of normal flux.  Examples of such
discretizations include mixed finite element methods and support
operator methods.  However, the first order form defines a saddle
point problem, and hence, its discretization leads to an indefinite
linear system.  In, the hybrid or local version of these
discretizations it is possible to eliminate the normal flux to obtain
a sparse symmetric positive definite system in the scalar unknowns.
Unfortunately, this reduced system has both cell and edge unknowns;
hence, the direct application of existing robust multigrid algorithms
is not possible. 
<p/>
<p>
Morel, Dendy, Hall, and White made the first attempt to apply
multigrid to the Morel Diffusion Scheme, a local support operator
method, by preconditioning the system with a five point operator on
the cell centers, to which "black box" multigrid could be
applied. Unfortunately, performance deteriorated dramatically for
highly skewed meshes. A second effort, approximately twice as fast,
applied multigrid directly to the problem by introducing fictitious
identity equations at the cell vertices. But for highly skewed meshes,
twice as fast as abysmally slow is still abysmally slow.  Thus we are
investigating possibly more efficient alternatives.  One example is a
two-grid method applied directly to the edge-based equations derived
by directly eliminating the cell centers; the coarse grid operator is
generated by Galerkin coarsening with operator induced interpolation
from vertical cell edges to horizontal cell edges; unfortunately,the
coarse grid operator has a fifteen point stencil.  Another example is
a two-grid method in which the coarser grid is generated by Galerkin
coarsening and operator-induced interpolation, where the interpolation
from cell edges to cell centers has an extended stencil; as a result,
the coarse grid cell center operator has a twenty-five point
stencil. Both of these methods exhibit very good convergence even in
the presence of severe skewing, but both have practical limitations
because of the extended coarse grid stencils. We will present results
on all four of these methods, considered as multigrid methods and as
preconditioners. We will also present results on 9-point
approximations of these last two coarse-grid operators.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) methods have been in use for a long time
for the solution of both parabolic and elliptic partial differential
equations.  In the case where good estimates of the eigenvalues of the
operator are available, the convergence of these methods can be dramatically
accelerated.
<p>
However, in the case of computation on parallel computers, the solution of the
tridiagonal system can impose an unreasonable overhead.  We discuss methods to
lower the overhead imposed by the solution of the corresponding tridiagonal
systems.  The proposed method has the same convergence properties as a
standard ADI method, but all of the solves run in approximately the same time
as the "fast" direction.  Hence, this acts like a "transpose-free" method
while still maintaining the smoothing properties of ADI.
<p>
Algorithms are derived and convergence theory is provided.  Numerical examples
on serial, parallel, and clusters of processors are provided showing how much
of a speed up can be gained by the new method.

<p>
The advantages of cellular decompositions of a computational domain
are becoming increasingly clear for a number of problem areas.  The
algorithm PUMG, introduced at the Seventh Copper Mountain Conference
in 1995, is particularly advantageous for such problems.  We present
recent results on the performance of PUMG. <p> The primary key to the
high rate of convergence of PUMG is the use of high-order polynomial
reconstruction (developed with Tim Barth [2] for use in conservative
simulations of flow on unstructured grids) when constructing the
projection and interpolation operators. <p> An even higher rate of
convergence is obtained through the use of multiple course grids at
each level, as is done in the algorithm PSMG developed with Oliver
McBryan [3].  This appears to be worthwhile primarily when convergence
would otherwise be unacceptably slow (or even nonexistent) because of
the stiff nature of the discretized operator. <p> For most of the
problems we have studied the use of an approximate inverse as smoother
has proven to be highly advantageous.  We continue to advocate the use
of the LS approximate inverse developed by Benson [4] because of its
wide applicability.  This smoother is constructed through the
minimization of a Frobenius norm, which leads to a computationally
easy problem.

<br>Abstract

<p>

In many fluid flow problems the spatial scale of the solution varies
significantly over the domain.  Solving such problems numerically often 
requires variable resolution to accurately resolve the small-scale
features without compromising the overall efficiency.  One common approach
is to superimpose nested uniform grids of varying mesh sizes.  Adaptive
multigrid methods take this idea one step further, taking full advantage
of the interaction between solutions on different grids to solve on all 
scales efficiently.  Multigrid processing also provides accurate estimates 
of the truncation error which can be used to decide automatically where to 
refine or coarsen the grid, leading to a "self-adaptive" method.
This approach is particularly attractive in problems where the regions
requiring mesh refinement change in time, since it has 
the potential of providing optimal accuracy or efficiency
with minimal human intervention.

<P>

We investigate the performance of such a method for the problem of
tracking the motion of a hurricane.  
Based on the simplest appropriate dynamical model 
(the nondivergent barotropic vorticity equation), 
the numerical model uses conservative second-order finite differences
and a multigrid method for solving the elliptic problem for the
streamfunction.
Grid sizes and locations are chosen automatically based on truncation 
error estimates computed during FAS multigrid processing,
and change as the vortex moves and evolves.
Analysis and numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the multigrid 
truncation error estimates, and
numerical results quantify the performance of the self-adaptive algorithm.
Using adaptive grids gives an order of magnitude improvement in
efficiency (compared to a uniform-grid version), and the self-adaptive
algorithm chooses grids which are nearly optimal. 
The computational overhead involved in adapting the grids is minimal.

Two-level algorithms for Overlapping Composite Mesh Difference Methods

<br>Abstract
</center>
<p>

We propose two-level solvers for (modified) composite mesh difference
methods.  These methods are finite difference discretisations on
overlapping subdomains, in which the continuity of the solution across the
subdomain boundaries is enforced by interpolating the discrete solution on
adjacent subdomains.  We are using modified composite mesh difference
methods which allow lower dimensional interpolation formulae to be used
along the interface of the nonmatching grids.  The advantage of this
approach is that fewer interpolation points are needed and the same order
of global accuracy is preserved.  This is important especially for
distributed memory implementations since smaller amounts of data need to be
communicated among the overlapping subdomains.

<p>

We focus on second order elliptic partial differential equations.  Several
interface interpolation schemes for overlapping nonmatching grids finite
difference methods are analysed.  We prove second order global accuracy of
the discretisation schemes.  A consistency condition is introduced for the
interpolation operator.  Under this condition we have that the accuracy is
independent of the overlap.  These modified composite mesh difference
methods only require a minimal overlap to achieve the accuracy.  The method
is cheaper than the classical interpolation method and also cheaper than
the overlapping nonmatching mortar method, which requires a global mortar
projection involving all the mesh points on the interface.

<p>

Since the composite mesh difference method is a contraction mapping, the
resulting system of equations can be solved by repeatedly solving the
subproblems in parallel.  The convergence rate of this iteration is bounded
by the contraction factor of the mapping.  Hence larger overlap reduces the
number of Schwarz iterations.  This is a parallel variant of the Schwarz
alternating method.  Instead of using the additive Schwarz method as a
solver, it is used as a (parallel) preconditioner in a Krylov subspace
iterative solver.  The performance of this preconditioner can be improved
by using absorbing boundary conditions as interface conditions.

<p>

We consider 2-level algorithms with both nested and nonnested coarse grids.
We construct the nonnested coarse grid independent of the overlapping fine
grids on the subdomains.  The interpolation operator from the coarse grid
to the overlapping fine grids can be computed quite easily since the
interpolation routines are already present in the composite mesh difference
method code.  The restriction operator from the overlapping fine grids to
the coarse grid is the transpose of the interpolation matrix with an
appropriate scaling.  This scaling is important especially in those parts
of the domain where the fine grids overlap.  The interpolation and
restriction operations are done efficiently as sparse matrix-vector
multiplications.

<p>

Two choices for the coarse grid problem are examined.  The first option is
to discretise the partial differential equation on the nonnested coarse
grid independent of the overlapping fine grids on the subdomains.  The
second possibility is to compute the coarse grid matrix by means of an
algebraic multigrid procedure using the interpolation and restriction
matrices and the fine grid matrix.  This approach is compared to a 2-level
solver based on a nested coarse grid, obtained by coarsening the
overlapping fine grids, as is done in algebraic multigrid solvers.  In this
case we obtain overlapping coarse grids.  The main topic addressed in this
talk is the selection of the coarse grid problem.  We also show results for
an algebraic multigrid solver for this problem.

Algebraic multi-grid (AMG) methods haven proven to be relatively robust black-box solvers with optimal
<em><b>O(N)</b></em> complexity for systems of <b>N</b> linear equations involving an M-matrix.
However, the discretization of coupled systems of differential 
equations does not lead to such a matrix, hence AMG is (in general) not applicable.
But the matrices arising from the discretization of coupled systems are block-structured and
we may associate every block (i.e. multiple unknowns) to one grid point.
Now, the task is to translate the AMG technique to this block setting.
Here the black-box character of AMG is lost, but this may be acceptable
due to the demand for fast and robust solvers for coupled systems.
<br><br>

For a Block-AMG method, the matrix is supplied in a block-structured form, i.e.
there are multiple unknowns associated to each grid point.
Now the principles of AMG, namely the coarse grid selection and algebraic construction of the interpolation
must be ported from the scalar to the block case.
The most basic aspect of AMG is the notion of strong couplings between certain unknowns.
Following the ideas of Brandt, McCormick, Ruge and Stueben,
the definition of strong couplings is based on the characterization of smooth errors
with respect to the Gauss-Seidel method. The first step in the construction of a
Block-AMG approach is the selection of a block-smoother such as Block-Gauss-Seidel or Distributive-Gauss-Seidel
schemes. Now a charaterization of smooth errors with respect to this smoother leads to
the notion of strong couplings between matrix blocks. This induces strong couplings between grid points.
Therefore we can define a coarsening scheme for the grid. Analogously, an algebraic block-interpolation
operator can be defined. Altogether, this results in a Block-AMG method for coupled systems of PDEs.
<br><br>

We discuss the pros and cons of this construction and present the results of numerical
experiments.

<p>
Smoothed aggregation, an Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG),
have proved to be a very efficient iterative method for
the solution of symmetric positive definite linear systems arizing
from the finite element discretization of elliptic boundary value
problems.<P></P>

In this AMG method, the prolongation operators are obtained in two
stages. 
The first stage consists in the 
construction of tentative prolongators using an aggregation
approach. More specifically, using a disjoint covering (aggregates)
of the set of
degrees of freedom on the fine level, the tentative prolongators from
the coarse level to the fine level
are simply obtained by reproducing the value
of the coarse level aggregates on the degrees of freedom belonging to
this aggregate. These tentative prolongators are exact for polynomials 
of degree 0  
but the piecewise constant coarse spaces that they generate 
contain high energy functions. Therefore, this first
stage is followed by a smoothing of the tentative prolongators in
order to obtain better stability properties. In smoothed aggregation method,
this smoothing is done using a polynomial in the discrete operator and
the choice of this polynomial is an important component of the method.  <P></P>

AMG method are usually Ritz-Galerkin methods where the test and basis
functions are identical. In smoothed aggregation method, this implies that the
coarsening ratio between two levels is 3 instead of the more usual factor 2.
The use of different coarsening
ratio instead of the factor 3 can be useful 
for non strictly symmetric problem, in a two-level setting using
polynomial smoothers of large degrees or simply because a large number
of existing MG softwares use a coarsening ratio of 2. In the present work
we will show that the smoothed aggregation
AMG method can be extended to any coarsening ratio, including even
ones. However, to preserve the complexity of the algorithm, this must be done
by the use of carefully selected smoothing
polynomials and we will show that there exists a definite relationship
between the degree of the polynomial smoother of the prolongator and the
coarsening ratio. <P></P>

The resulting methods do not fit in the 
classical variational framework but are more naturally interpreted as
Petrov Galerkin methods. 
However, we will show that it is possible to interpret these methods
as Ritz-Galerkin ones 
using modified transfer and smoothing operators.
This interpretation gives theoretical justification
to the use of even coarsening ratio and provides a convergence theory for
these Petrov-Galerkin AMG methods using the BPWX framework. <P></P>

The paper will also present some numerical experiments for 
solving convection diffusion problems. In the approach that has been
followed in these experiments, the smoothed aggregation
Petrov-Galerkin method is extended to non-symmetric problems by constructing
polynomial smoothers of the aggregation prolongator using the elliptic part
of the discrete operator. These numerical experiments indicates that smoothed
aggregation AMG methods have also encouraging potentialities for solving
non-symmetric problems.

<CENTER><br>Abstract</CENTER>


<P>The data structure derived from non-overlapping domain decomposition
can be used easily in iterative solvers. Problems appear with those
local matrices containing also information from other subdomains. As long
as we accumulate them only locally, (distributed) matrices from FEM do
not cause these problems. Globally accumulated matrices have to fulfill
a special admissible pattern property to preserve their easy parallel handling.

<P>If the coarsest grid is distributed statically and if all refined elements
belong to the same subdomain as their father element then the standard
prolongation/restriction in a MG algorithm requires no communication at
all. The same holds for all matrix-by-vector products with the distributed
FEM-matrices of all levels.

<P>The situation changes in the case of AMG.
<BR>In order to apply the non-overlapping data structure and subroutines
of the finest grid also on the coarser grids we have to do the following
modifications in comparison with the classical AMG:
<UL>
<LI>
The coarsening is locally hierarchic.</LI>

<LI>
The prolongation/restriction has to be restricted to admissible matrix
patterns, i.e., we use a modification of the classical approach.</LI>

<LI>
Then, the coarse grid matrices resulting from the Galerkin approach behave
again as locally accumulated matrices.</LI>
</UL>
Although we lose some global information in comparison to classical AMG,
we think
<BR>that our approach results in nearly optimal convergence rates - but
it is much easier to
<BR>parallelize than the first one.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The 3D DC resistivity experiment is a large industrial problem solved on a daily basis in environmental and mining exploration. The forward problem involves solving
Poisson equation with the conductivity as a parameter.
<p>
In the inverse problem we try to recover the conductivity using the measured
potentials at the surface. Such problem is typically ill-posed and therefore
Tikhonov regularization is used.
<p>
There are few difficulties in solving the inverse problem. First, the 
sensitivities has to be calculated. This is a large and dense matrix
which  is difficult to calculate especially in 3D. Second, the sensitivity
matrix is inverted and the solution is updated.
<p>
In this talk we present an alternative to this process. First we show
that one does not need to calculate the sensitivity matrix at all.
Rather one could calculate the product of the sensitivity and a vector
in a very efficient method which is equivalent to sparse matrix operation.
Second, we employ this methodology and use Krylov-Newton method. In this
way we avoid the direct inversion of the sensitivity matrix.
Finally, we compare  the different algorithms on a synthetic example.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
High speed cache memory is commonly used to address the disparity between the
speed of a computer's central processing unit and the speed of a computer's
main memory.  Hence, it is advantageous to maximize the amount of time that
data spends in cache.  Various compiler and programmer dependent software
techniques have been developed to enhance cache usage.  These techniques are
not able, however, to handle dynamically changing data structures, such as
those encountered in adaptively chosen, unstructured grids.  Such grids
commonly arise in many real world applications.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Multigrid codes spend most of their running time in the smoother or rougher
procedure.  We develop a variant of Gauss-Seidel that is both cache aware and
bit-wise compatible with standard implementations.  We apply it to (coupled)
second order elliptic partial differential equations with variable
coefficients.  Our variant keeps data in cache memory for much longer than
standard implementations that are cache unaware.  Thus, our method is
significantly faster.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We provide timing results and cache use statistics for an unstructured grid,
multicomponent multigrid code that incorporates our cache aware procedures.

In this paper we discuss Multigrid methods for Topelitz matrices. Then
the restriction and prolongation operator and the smoothing operator
can be seen as Toeplitz or Block Toeplitz matrices. Because of the intimate 
connection between such matrices and
trigonometric series we can express the Multigrid algorithm  in terms of
the underlying functions. The zeroes of this function mainly determine
the Multigrid algorithm. This shows how to choose the 
prolongation/restriction- and smoothing operator in order to get fast 
convergence.
The derived formalism can be used to analyse Multigrid methods
for PDE in the case of constant coefficients on a regular grid, e.g.
 the Helmholtz equation.

We consider the two-dimensional convection diffusion equation with
closed characteristics on unstructured triangular meshes
and study problems with dominant convection.
We present a detailed analysis 
for a representative number of model problems. The investigation is based on 
Fourier analysis in the case of a very simple model problem and on numerical 
experiments for more realistic situations.
The experiments have been carried 
out on the software platform <a href="http://dom.ica3.uni-stuttgart.de/~ug">UG</a>
using grids with up to 400.000 unknowns to investigate 
the asymptotic behaviour. 
As a result we present a multigrid scheme for this class of problems
which is robust w.r.t. to the Peclet number as well as to
the amount of crosswind diffusion introduced by the discretization scheme.
The method is based on a robust Gauss-Seidel type smoother using an ordering strategy
and a special treatment of the cyclic dependencies.
Moreover a modification of the coarse grid correction is neccessary to improve the
discrete approximation property. The presented method is of optimal
complexity (up to a logarithmic factor). <br>

<dd> For practical use (problems with non-vanishing crosswind diffusion on grids up to
1.000.000 unknowns) we show that a modification based on 
Krylov space methods leads to an robust method of optimal complexity.
The resulting algorithm is well suited for more complex problems in which
dominant convection plays an important role. 
An application to the

<p>

In this talk we present an algebraic multigrid (AMG)
solver for finite element applications. The new method differs
from classical AMG in that we exploit information about
the fine-grid elements; namely, the lists of the degrees of freedom
for each element and the respective element matrices. The new method
is closely related to AMGe (Brezina et. al., Copper Mountain 1998),
an approach for using finite element information to improve the
robustness of classical AMG.

<p>
The agglomeration based AMG algorithm differs from classical AMG
only in the coarsening process which consists of selecting the coarse
grid and building the interpolation operator. The coarse grid is
based on the construction of coarse elements created by agglomerating
fine grid elements. Once the coarse elements are identified, 
a compatible set of local prolongation operators (i.e., within each
agglomerated element) are constructed. By compatible we mean: fine grid
degrees of freedom shared by two agglomerated coarse grid elements
are interpolated only from coarse degrees of freedom common to
the two elements. The coarse grid element matrices are then computed
in the usual (variational or Galerkin) way,
and one can apply the same coarsening procedure recursively on the coarse grid.

<p>
The element agglomeration strategy can have a large impact on the
convergence of the method, particularly for anisotropic problems.
Our current strategy is somewhat similar
to the algorithm for selecting coarse grid points in classical AMG. 
Using only the above mentioned information about the fine-grid elements,
we construct a measure of "strength of connection" between elements.
The agglomeration algorithm uses this measure and graphs describing
element connectivity (which can be constructed from the
lists of the degrees of freedom for each element) to identify the elements
to agglomerate.
We present numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method for various test problems.

<p>
An efficient method for solving the sparse linear system of equations
arising from the finite element or finite difference
discretisations of the linearised
steady state Navier-Stokes or Oseen equations is given.
 
Due to features such as boundary layers in the true solution of these
equations, it may be necessary to reduce the
element size in proportion to any decrease in viscosity. Furthermore,
the use of Krylov subspace iterative 
methods to solve such systems produces convergence rates that are
dependent on both element size and viscosity. Hence, a preconditoner 
that has little or no dependence on either mesh size or viscosity
is required. 

In this work we present an upper block triangular preconditioner 
which produces convergence rates that have only mild dependence on 
viscosity, while they are seen to improve with
refinement of the mesh.
The preconditioner is successfully applied to the MAC finite 
difference scheme and a wide range of 
mixed finite elements, including both stable and stabilised 
triangular and quadrilateral elements. 

In the finite difference case, results show that the preconditioner
seems to have the same viscosity dependence as the BFBt preconditioner
proposed by Elman, but no mesh dependence is apparent.   

It is shown that a practical implementation of the preconditioner 
can be achieved using multigrid as an inexact solve on the 
preconditioner. With just a couple of simple multigrid
cycles applied to the preconditioner convergence rates similar 
to those of the exact inversion of the preconditioner are obtained.   
Multigrid is used on both uniform and non-uniform mesh refinements.

<br>Abstract

<p>
Two-level additive Schwarz and traditional multigrid methods with many
recursively coarsened representations represent two extremes of multilevel
preconditioners. Both are provably optimal in the sense of condition
number stabilization for a broad class of elliptically dominated problems,
but their parallel complexity properties are different.  Complexity
differences arise from differences in the number and size of coarse
problems to be solved, in the quality of the subproblem solutions, in the
type of intergrid transfer operators, and in additive versus
multiplicative combination of the subproblem solutions.
<p>
Two-level additive Schwarz methods map with ideal concurrency and locality
onto distributed memory architectures with one subdomain per processor.
Data-parallel implementations of traditional multigrid methods can be more
vulnerable to fine-grained communication.  On the other hand, additive
Schwarz is not generally sufficient as a standalone solver. Though its
condition number is asymptotically independent of problem size and
processor granularity, it needs to be accelerated. Traditional multigrid
is potentially far superior per cycle as a standalone solver and as a
preconditioner. 
<p>
These considerations lead to a trade-off in parallel cost per iteration
versus overall number of iterations -- a trade-off which is
architecture-dependent and, ultimately, problem-dependent.  In this talk,
we address this trade-off for nonlinear radiation diffusion problems 
solved with matrix-free Newton-Krylov.

<p>
We develop a parallel, two-level, solver for 3 dimensional (3-D),
unstructured grid, nonsymmetric , elliptic problems. The solver
is a preconditioned GMRES method with cell centered finite volume
spatial discretization.  The preconditioner can be viewed
as a two-level Schwarz method or a two-grid multigrid V-cycle with
aggressive coarsening. Our coarse grid correction employs simple
summation and injection for inter-grid transfer operators and
a variational method to construct the coarse grid operator.  These
choices have resulted in a minimum of software complexity.  
The true discretization operator is only realized in the
GMRES matrix - vector multiplies, while a simpler discretization
is used to form the preconditioning matrix.  If required, nonlinear
iterations are implemented via the matrix-free Newton-Krylov
method. Parallel algorithm results will be presented presented.

<p>
We present an FAS-like scheme for the implementation of
multilevel projection methods for nonlinear least-squares finite element computations.
It is based on a sequence of successive
subspace corrections which are stopped based on a criterion measuring the relative
change of the nonlinear least-squares functional.
This solver is applied to the least-squares mixed finite element formulation of
the nonlinear elliptic problems arising in each time-step of an implicit Euler
discretization for variably saturated flow. The least-squares ansatz allows
the use of standard piecewise linear
H<sup>1</sup>-conforming finite elements for the hydraulic potential combined with
the H(div)-conforming Raviart-Thomas spaces for the flux.
It also provides an a posteriori error estimator which may be used in an 
adaptive mesh refinement strategy.
The FAS multilevel method is applied to provide level-independent convergence
rates, making use of the hierarchy of nested grids obtained by the adaptive
refinement process.
For a realistic water table recharge problem, the results of computational
experiments are presented.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Years ago, knowing how many floating point multiplies were used in a given
algorithm (or code) provided a good measure of the running time of a program.
This was a good measure for comparing different algorithms to solve the same
problem.
This is no longer true.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Many current computer designs, including the node architecture of most
parallel supercomputers, employ caches and a hierarchical memory architecture.
Therefore the speed of a code (e.g., multigrid) depends increasingly on how
well the cache structure is exploited.
The number of cache misses provides a better measure for comparing algorithms
than the number of multiplies.
Unfortunately, estimating cache misses is difficult to model a priori and only
somewhat easier to do a posteriori.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Typical multigrid applications are running on data sets much too large to fit
into the caches.
Thus, copies of the data that are once brought to the cache should be reused
as often as possible.
For multigrid, the possible number of reuses is always at least as great as
the number of iterations of the smoother or rougher.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In this talk, suitable blocking strategies for both structured and
unstructured grids will be introduced.
They improve the cache usage without changing the underlying algorithm.
In particular, bitwise compatibility is guaranteed between the standard and
the high performance implementations of the algorithms.
This is illustrated by comparisons for various multigrid algorithms on a
selection of different computers for problems in two and three dimensions.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The code restructuring can yield a performance improvement by up to a factor
of 5.
This allows the modified codes to achieve a quite high percentage of the peak
performance of the CPU, something that is rarely seen with standard
implementations.
For example, on a DEC Alpha 21164 processor based workstation, better than 650
out of a possible 1000 megaflops has been achieved.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
Algebraic multigrid methods construct a hierarchy of coarser levels,
including the corresponding transfer operators in an automatic way. The
information required for this setup is taken from the given
finest-level matrix. For various types of matrices, the original approach
as implemented in the public domain code amg1r5, has proven to be robust
and efficient.  In particular, the code can directly be applied to a wide
range of discretized elliptic PDEs on unstructured grids, both in 2D and 3D.
<p>
The original code, however, has some serious drawbacks if applied to complex
3D problems. In particular, for industrial applications workspace requirements
(and robustness) are even more important than optimal convergence properties
for model problems.  Modifications of the coarse grid selection process and
the calculation of the interpolation weights have been incoporated in a new
code in order to meet these industrial requirements.
<p>
<p>
Since the hierarchy of coarser levels and the related operators develop
dynamically during the setup phase of an AMG algorithm, it is quite
difficult to parallelize AMG efficiently. A "native" parallelization
would, in general, require unpredictable and highly complex
communication patterns which seriously limit the achievable efficiency,
in particular of the setup phase. In addition, the original AMG approach
contains inherently sequential algorithmic components to construct the
coarser levels.
<p>
A parallelization approach is presented which limits the communication
without sacrificing convergence in complex situations. Results will be
presented for industrial CFD applications on various parallel machines.
<p>
A successor code of the amg1r5 has been developed which provides the following
additional features : <br>
- low memory variants based on aggressive coarsening and more flexible
  interpolation <br>
- dynamic memory mangement based on FORTRAN90 <br>
- MIMD parallelization using MPI <br>
- full support for using  AMG as a preconditioner (GMRES,BICGSTAB and CG)
  in both the parallel and sequential case <br>
- various options for solving the coarsest grid equation in the parallel
  case (parallel direct solver, sequential direct solver combined with
   process-agglomeration, iterative procedures with local AMG or ILU as preconditioner) <br

<br>Abstract

<p>
The numerical software package FEPP is intended to tackle a wide range 
of problems arising in mathematical physics which can be formulated as 
(systems) of partial differential equations. Consequently, various 
numerical schemes have to be provided in order to meet the particular 
demands of each problem. Having in mind Finite Element Methods this 
involves appropriate finite element spaces, e.g., nodal- and edge-based 
basis functions. Furthermore, other discretization techniques, e.g., 
Boundary Element Methods, lead to completely different types of 
matrices (full instead of sparse). All these differences cause 
different needs for the distribution of data as well as for the 
parallel generation and solution of the discrete systems. Hereby, we 
restrict our considerations to algorithms designed for machines with 
distributed memory.</P>
<P>
In particular, we look for a unifying concept which minimizes those 
parts of the code which are specific for some strategy of 
parallelization. Moreover, an extension to new numerical schemes and 
new techniques of parallelization should be easy to realize. Hereby, we 
exploit essentially the concept of operator overloading and inheritance 
provided by C++. </P>
<P>
Moreover, we observe that all the parallel techniques under 
consideration lead to one and the same parallel iterative algorithm 
applied to particular vector types which correspond to the kind of data 
distribution. For example, a row-wise distribution of a square matrix 
leads to row and column vectors of different size, whereas a 
non-overlapping distribution of finite elements gives rise to 
overlapping and adding-type vectors. Then the most essential operation 
of the parallel iteration is the type-conversion of such vectors, i.e., 
the conversion from row-vectors to column-vectors and from adding-type 
to overlapping vectors. This conversion is hidden in the preconditioner 
or, more precisely, in the smoother if multigrid is used as 
preconditioner. The calculation of scalar products is the only 
remaining operation which has to be overloaded correctly. </P>
<P>
In our talk, we discuss this general concept and in particular how the 
type-conversion of vectors can be organized. Additionally we point out 
which interfaces have to be provided to parallelize a given sequential 
numerical simulation code.</P>

<p>

We consider the numerical simulation of electromagnetic devices such as 
electrical machines or transformers. The devices are modeled mathematically
by a system of PDEs, derived form the Maxwell equations. A finite
element discretization of the equations leads to large and sparse linear 
system. The solution of those systems dominates the overall execution 
time of the numerical simulation. Hence, our research into more efficient 
solvers and more effective preconditioners for Krylov subspace methods.

<p>

The Maxwell equations reduce to a nonlinear diffusion problem for the 
z-component of the magnetic vector potential, in the case of two-dimensional
magnetostatic computations. The geometry of the model can be quite complex 
in the real-life engineering problems that we are faced with. The geometry is 
therefore discretised by unstructured and adaptively refined finite element 
meshes. The PDE-coefficients in our models are usually discontinuous due to 
different materials characteristics. In our package, linear finite elements
are used.

<p>

We will compare the performance of the Ruge/Stueben Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) 
code to the CG-method  with SSOR preconditioner that was implemented before 
in the package, for solving magnetostatic problems. 
We will illustrate the mesh size independent convergence behaviour of AMG, 
and the stabilizing effect on the convergence obtained by a CG acceleration. 
In the nonlinear calculation of a synchronous line-start motor the use of 
AMG/CG resulted in a six fold reduction of the CPU-time compared  to the
SSOR/CG solver. 

<p>

Next, we will discuss the use of AMG for solving the linear systems that arise 
from the discretization of the low-frequent time-harmonic Maxwell equations. 
Assuming a two dimensional geometry and a sinusoidally excitation, the Maxwell 
equations reduce to a nonlinear Helmholtz problem with a complex shift. 
The finite element discretization results in a linear system with sparse, 
complex symmetric (but non-hermitian) coefficient matrix. 
To solve this system by AMG, we reformulate it into the equivalent real 
system of double dimension. The recently developed GMD-AMG-code by Stueben
is then used to solve this problem.  We will comment on various solution
approaches and multigrid component selections.  We will illustrate the 
efficiency with numerical results for different practical engineering devices.

The Sparse-Grid Combination Technique for a Time-Dependent Advection Problem

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The long-term aim of the present work is to make significant progress in the 
numerical solution of large-scale transport problems:
systems of partial differential equations of the advection-diffusion-reaction
type, used in the modeling of pollution of 
the atmosphere, surface water and ground water.
The three-dimensional nature of these models and the necessity of
modeling transport and
chemical exchange between different components over long time spans,
requires very efficient algorithms. For advanced three-dimensional modeling,
computer capacity (computing time and memory) still is a severe
limiting factor. This limitation is felt in particular in the area of
global air pollution modeling where the three-dimensional
nature leads to huge numbers
of grid points in each of which many calculations must be carried out.
The application of sparse-grid techniques,
which have already proven useful in multi-grid-accelerated solution methods,
might offer a promising way-out.
Of course, this should go without loss of accuracy and
in combination with an appropriate, efficient time stepping process.
Sparse grids were introduced by Zenger in the early nineties
to reduce the degrees of freedom in finite element calculations.
Recent literature in the field of reactive flow problems and multi-grid methods
for stationary differential equations confines this very promising development.
<p>
Contrary to most multi-grid methods, the combination technique
is an extrapolation technique rather than a defect-correction method. The
final solution is a linear combination of solutions on semi-coarsened grids,
where the coefficients of the combination are chosen such that there is a
canceling in leading-order error terms. For a d-dimensional problem
(d>1), the solution on a single grid of mesh width h requires 
~ h<sup>-d</sup> degrees of freedom to obtain an accuracy of O(h<sup>2</sup>),
when using linear interpolation. In comparison, the combination technique could
solve this problem using ~ h<sup>-1</sup>(log h<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>d-1</sup>
degrees of freedom to obtain an accuracy of 
O(h<sup>2</sup> (log h<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>d-1</sup>). This clearly
shows the potential of the combination technique. In fact, the
complexity is only one-dimensional, except for a logarithmic factor, while the
accuracy is only deteriorated by a logarithmic factor. Another appealing 
property of the combination technique is that it is inherently parallelizable, 
i.e., it constructs the final solution from ~ 
(log h<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>d-1</sup> independent solutions which can be computed 
in parallel.
<p>
In the present work an analysis is given of the error that remains in the
solution after applying the combination technique. Basically there are three
sources of error: discretization errors, prolongation errors and an
intrinsic representation error. The discretization errors are present in the
semi-coarsened solutions due to spatial and temporal discretization. In the
current work the temporal discretization errors are neglected.
The prolongation errors are picked up when the semi-coarsened solutions are
projected onto the fine grid. The representation error is always present in
the combined solution, even if the semi-coarsened solutions are error-free.
The representation error is of interest when the combination technique is
used as a means of efficient function representation. When it is used to
solve a differential equation, it is of less significance because then the
combined discretization errors are dominant. 
<A HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/~boris/sparse6/sparse6.html">Error analysis for 
function representation by the sparse-grid combination technique</A> is a 
report on the representation error by the first two authors. The focus of the 
present 
work is on how the discretization errors that exist on the semi-coarsened
grids propagate onto the fine grid where the final solution is constructed.
In particular, it is shown how the discretization errors and prolongation
errors interact. For example, it is shown that the order of the prolongation 
must
match the order of the spatial discretization. The analysis leads to an
explicit error expression for initial-value problems, providing insight into
the structure of the error.
<p>
An interesting conclusion from the analysis is that for initial-value
problems the error increases quadratically in time instead of linearly, as it
does for a single-grid solution. The implication of this is that the time
span over which the semi-coarse solutions are evolved should be limited. One
way to limit the time span is to apply the combination technique repeatedly,
each time doing a limited propagation in time, instead of a single
propagation over a longer time interval.
<p>
Another key observation consists of how the discretization errors from the
semi-coarsened grids manifest themselves on the fine grid. In particular, it
is shown that error terms proportional to hx<sup>p</sup> hy<sup>p</sup> 
play a prominent role,
i.e., they produce an error term proportional to 
h<sup>p</sup> log h<sup>-1</sup> on the fine grid,
for a two-dimensional problem. In fact, the leading-order error term on the
fine grid comes forth from error terms proportional to 
hx<sup>2</sup> hy<sup>2</sup>  on the semi-coarsened grids, 
for linear interpolation. This observation raises the question
whether it is possible to eliminate the leading hx<sup>p</sup> hy<sup>p</sup> 
term from the
expansion of the discretization error on the semi-coarsened grids by
choosing a suitable spatial discretization. Some preliminary results on such
discretizations will be presented.
<p>
Numerical experiments will be presented that confirm the analysis. 
Furthermore,
results of a set of numerical tests (one of which is the Molenkamp test) are 
presented that illustrate the strong and weak points of the combination 
technique when applied to time-dependent problems. In particular, it will 
become apparent that grid-aligned problems are especially well suited to the 
combination technique.

<p>
The equivalent source technique plays an important role in
processing geophysical potential-field data. Constructing an
equivalent source requires the inversion of a Fredholm integral
equation of the first kind in two-dimensions. In practise the
solution is obtained by solving a  linear system of equations.
Unfortunately, the  coefficient matrix is dense and the
solution becomes prohibitively expensive for large problems. We have
developed an efficient algorithm that uses fast wavelet transforms
based on orthonormal, compactly supported wavelets. The coefficient
matrix is treated as a four-dimensional image, and a separable
multidimensional wavelet transform, and subsequent thresholding, are
applied to generate a sparse representation in wavelet domain. 
The wavelet transform of the equivalent source is constructed
directly by performing a regularized inversion using the sparse matrix.
The inverse solution is obtained by limiting
the number of iterations in a conjugate gradient least-squares algorithm.
The iteration number acts as an implicit regularization parameter and
the CG solution is terminated when the expected data misfit has been
achieved.  The resulting algorithm reduces the solution time by up to
two orders of magnitude.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Standard multigrid methods are not well suited for solving
operators with anisotropic coefficients. Several methods to deal with anisotropic
operators have been proposed in the multigrid literature. Alternating-plane
smoothers with standard coarsening have been found to be highly efficient
and robust for anisotropic discrete operators on single-block grids.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Multiblock grids are needed to deal with complex geometries
in computational fluid dynamics. Block-structured grids limit the application
of the plane-implicit smoother to only a portion (block) of the computational
domain because there may be no natural definition of global lines or planes,
and so the plane smoother becomes a block-wise plane smoother. Block-wise
smoothers may also be used to facilitate the parallel implementation of
multigrid on structured grids. A block-wise strategy also opens possibilities
for using adaptive smoothers.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The purpose of this contribution is to study whether the
optimal properties of plane-implicit smoothers deteriorate for multiblock
grids, i.e., when they are not applied globally, but inside each block.
Results for the 3-D anisotropic diffusion equation show that the block-wise
plane method works as an efficient smoother for low anisotropies, i.e.
the convergence rate does not deteriorate. For very high anisotropies,
the convergence rate does deteriorate and the block-wise plane smoother
becomes a domain decomposition solver.The deterioration of the convergence
rate for multiblock applications where a strong anisotropy crosses a block
interface can be overcome by allowing an overlap of the subdomains at the
block interface.If the amount of overlap is increased proportionally with
the increase in the strength of the anisotropy, textbook multigrid efficiency
can be maintained. Even when an extremely strong anisotropy extends across
multiple blocks and interfaces, moderate overlap can maintain good convergence.
At block interfaces not crossed by a strong anisotropy, a minimal overlap
is needed.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Block-wise alternating-plane relaxation methods are found
to be robust smoothers; therefore their use should be considered for inclusion
in the next generation of production codes for computational fluid dynamics.
They present better convergence rates than domain decomposition methods.
In fact, their convergence rates are bounded by the convergence rate in
the corresponding domain decomposition solver.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We have already tested a lexicographic order for the alternating-plane
smoother and for the block updating. However, in order to run the code
on parallel computers, so that each processor solves a set of blocks, the
update sequence must present a high degree ofparallelism. Therefore, we
have also analyzed the smoothing properties of a red-black block update

<P>
The method of total reduction (Schroeder, Trottenberg, 1973)
is a direct multilevel method for the solution of the linear 
system of equations resulting from the discretization of an elliptic 
partial differential operator with constant coefficients. Based on the
standard coarsening of grids, it iteratively eliminates all fine-grid 
variables from the coarse-grid equations. On arriving at the coarsest grid,
the equation (with only one unknown) is solved directly. The other 
unknowns are obtained by back-substitution on finer and finer grids.

<P>
In the simplest 1D case, one discretizes -u'' with [-1, 2, -1]. Applying 
the reduction, one observes that the coarse-grid equations remaining are
of the same form as the fine-grid equations, viz., -u'' discretized on
the coarse gride with the <I>same</I> star [-1, 2, -1]. In the 2D case,
the Laplace operator is discretized with the standard 5-point star. 
Applying the reduction, the coarse-grid equations are <I>not</I> the 
same as the fine-grid equations. They are, in fact, the the equations 
resulting from discretizing the Laplace operator on the coarse grid 
with a <I>larger</I> star. Iterating, one obtains a sequence of larger
and larger stars. It has been shown (Zimare, 1980) that these stars,
when normalized, converge to an infinitely large star with exponentially
decaying coefficients.

<P>
The method of total reduction has a fixed method for the elimination
of the fine-grid variables, which is based on the original star. We 
pose the question: is there possibly another way of eliminating the 
fine-grid variables of the system of equations resulting from the 5-point
discretization of the Laplacian, or is there another consistent 
discretization of the Laplacian, such that the coarse grid stars are
all the same (as was the case in 1D)?

<P>
We show that this is <I>not</I> possible for any consistent discretization 
of the Laplacian. Moreover, it is not possible for the discretization of
any 2D differential operator unless the discretization is the tensor 
product of 1D stars. 

<P>
The convergence of stars and related methods are discussed.

<P><A HREF="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jmandel/papers/mini.ps.gz">Mandel,
Brezina and Vanek</A>&nbsp; (1998, Computing, to appear) have proposed
a fast iterative method to optimize coarse basis functions in algebraic
multigrid by minimizing the sum of their energies, subject to the condition
that linear combinations of the basis functions equal to given zero energy
modes, and subject to their supports, i.e., nonzero structure of the prolongation.
This construction is an outgrowth of the fundamental principles formulated
by <A HREF="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jmandel/papers/meis.ps.gz">Vanek, Mandel,
and Brezina, Computing, 1996:</A>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>minimization of energy: </I>coarse basis functions should have as small
energy as possible;</LI>

<LI>
<I>preservation of nullspace:</I> the zero energy modes should be contained
in the range of the prolongation, away from essential boudary conditions;</LI>

<LI>
<I>limited overlap:</I> the supports of coarse basis functions must overlap
as little as possible to guarantee sparsity of coarse matrices.</LI>
</UL>
The coarse minimal functions were constructed by projected gradient method,
which in this case is equivalent to smoothing a tentative, piecewise constant
prolongation, and projection on the space zero energy modes. The convergence
rate of this minimization algorithm to construct the coarse basis functions
is proved to be bounded independently of the meshsize under usual assumptions
on finite elements. In the case when the initial approximation was obtained
by aggregation of nodes, and the support of the coarse basis functions
is the aggregate plus one layer of neighboring nodes, the first iteration
gives exactly the same basis functions as an earlier method ( <A HREF="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jmandel/papers/meis.ps.gz">Vanek,
Mandel, and Brezina, Computing, 1996</A> ) using smoothed aggregation.
The construction applies to scalar problems as well as for linear elasticity,
and computational results on difficult industrial problems show that the
use of energy minimal coarse basis functions yields a slightly more robust
multigrid algorithm than smoothed aggregation alone.

<P><A HREF="ftp://ftp.math.ucla.edu/pub/camreport/cam97-18.ps.gz">Wan (1997)</a>
 and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.math.ucla.edu/pub/camreport/cam98-6.ps.gz">Wan,
Chan and Smith (1998)</A> have proposed the same definition of coarse basis
functions in the scalar case and the more usual coarsening pattern by a
ratio of 2, and proposed a construction by Lagrange multipliers. They have
shown that in some cases, this definition of coarse basis functions results
in the same basis functions as in geometrical multigrid.

<P>In this talk, we survey the above results and apply the projected gradient
method to standard coarsening by ratio of 2. Only few iterations of the
projected gradient method are needed to obtain good coarse basis functions.

<p>
The development and testing of a parallel unstructured agglomeration
multigrid algorithm for steady-state aerodynamic flows is discussed.
The agglomeration multigrid strategy uses a graph algorithm
to construct the coarse multigrid levels from the given fine grid,
similar to an algebraic multigrid approach,
but operates directly on the non-linear system using the FAS approach.
An isotropic agglomeration version which operates on an un-weighted
graph as well as a directional agglomeration approach
(operating on a weighted graph) have both been devised and tested.
Two preconditioning techniques are employed to relieve stiffness
due to high-aspect ratio grid cells in the boundary layer regions,
and the stiffness associated with regions of nearly incompressible flow.
<p>

The preconditioned multigrid solver is parallelized using
the domain-decomposition approach with the MPI message passing interface.
The scalability and convergence rate of the resulting multigrid algorithm
using the isotropic and directional agglomeration strategies is examined
on an SGI ORIGIN 2000 and a Cray T3E.  The scalability of the
single (non-multigrid) algorithm is contrasted with that of the multigrid
algorithm using a V and a W-cycle.  For medium size problems involving
several million grid points, near perfect scalability is obtained for the single
grid algorithm, while only a slight drop-off in parallel efficiency is observed
for the multigrid V and W-cycles, using up to 128 processors on the
SGI Origin 2000, and up to 512 processors on the Cray T3E.
For a large problem using 25 million grid points, good scalability
is observed for the multigrid algorithm
using up to 1450 processors on a Cray T3E, even when the coarsest grid level
contains fewer points than the total number of processors.
<p>

At present, various preprocessing operations, which
require little overall cpu time, such as the coarse level
construction and the partitioning of these levels
are performed sequentially.  Future work will concentrate
on parallelizing all of these aspects fo the solver on distributed
memory parallel machines.

Approaches to Parallel Multigrid with the Full Domain Partition
</center>

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>

The parallel implementation of numerical algorithms usually involves
distributing the data across the processors and communicating updated
values between the processors as needed so that the parallel implementation
is mathematically identical to a sequential implementation.  In the case
of a multigrid algorithm this requires passing data at least once on each
level during a cycle, which results in a relatively high communication to
computation ratio in terms of the number of messages sent.  This may be
feasible on massively parallel supercomputers with high speed networks, but
it is deadly on architectures with relatively low-speed high-latency
networks like a network of workstations or cluster of PCs.
<p>
The Full Domain Partition (FuDoP) has recently been developed as a means of
reducing the number of messages that must be sent in a parallel multigrid
method and has been applied in the context of adaptively refined grids.
With FuDoP the adaptive or uniform grid is partitioned for distribution
across the processors as usual.  But in addition to the elements (say,
triangles) of the assigned partition, a processor contains extra elements
resulting in a grid that covers the full domain.  These extra elements come
from coarser refinement levels and are selected to provide a compatible
grid with a near-minimum number of extra elements.  The resulting grid on
each processor is as if the processor performed adaptive refinement with
zero as the error indicator outside the region of its partition, so
triangles outside that region are refined only as required for compatibility.
In fact, this is the way the FuDoP grids are usually generated for adaptive
grids, although there may be other ways to obtain them for uniform grids.
<p>
With FuDoP it is possible to design a parallel multigrid algorithm that is
nearly identical to the sequential algorithm and uses only two communication
steps per cycle.  We consider a multigrid method based on the hierarchical
basis using a Gauss-Siedel smoother with red relaxation on the coarsening
half of a V-cycle and red-black relaxation on the other half.  Each processor
performs the coarsening half of the V-cycle on its grid with no communication
between processors.  At the bottom of the V-cycle the processors exchange
solution values and right hand side residuals (injections from finer grids)
for all vertices that have shadow copies on other processors.  The second
half of the V-cycle proceeds without communication.  The second communication
step occurs at the top of the V-cycle when the processors exchange solution
values for the shadow copies.  The mathematical difference between this
parallel algorithm and the corresponding sequential algorithm is due to the
lag by one iteration of some values associated with vertices outside a
processor's partition.  Numerical results with a model Poisson problem have
shown the parallel algorithm to have nearly the same convergence rate as
the sequential algorithm.
<p>
Recently another investigator has proposed to take this approach to the extreme
and develop a parallel adaptive multigrid method that performs no communication
during the bulk of the process.  In this approach a single processor solves
the differential equation on a relatively coarse grid, estimates the relative
amount of refinement that will occur in each element, partitions the grid
and distributes the partitions to the other processors.  Each processor
creates a FuDoP grid from its partition and proceeds with the adaptive
refinement and multigrid solution on its grid without ever communicating
with other processors.  When the grid is determined to be fine enough, a
standard parallel solver, such as preconditioned conjugate gradients, is
applied on the composite grid.  Without communication, the multigrid
algorithm here is not solving the same linear system, but numerical results
indicate that it is close enough to guide the adaptive refinement and give
a very good initial guess for the final solver.
<p>
One can imagine several variants on parallel multigrid with FuDoP that fall
in between these two extremes.  For example, one could use the FuDoP multigrid
with no communication as a preconditioner for parallel conjugate gradients.
Again the multigrid with no communication would not converge to the correct
solution, but as a preconditioner it only needs to approximately solve the
linear system.  In this paper we will present some variations on the algorithm.
Numerical results will be presented to examine the effect on convergence
rates and execution times.

<p>
To meet the increasing demand for predictive numerical simulations
in large-scale problems, such as forecasting petroleum reservoir
performance and subsurface contaminant flow, parallel computing has
become a necessary tool.  For example, many time-dependent numerical
simulations sacrifice implicit time stepping because of a lack of robust
and efficient parallel iterative solvers.  However, the cost of
proprietory parallel supercomputers, such as the Origin 2000, is
daunting if not prohibitive.  In contrast, the viability of
workstation clusters has increased steadily with the performance and
robustness of <em>open source</em> software (e.g., GNU/Linux) and with
the increasing power of commodity hardware (e.g., 100Base-TX ethernet
switches).  In the Theoretical Divison at Los Alamos this realization
eventually led to the construction of 
<a href="http://cnls.lanl.gov/avalon/">Avalon</a>, a cluster of 140
DEC/Alpha PCs that communicate through a fast ethernet switch.  The
base software consists of RedHat Linux 5.0 (running the 2.2.x kernel),
the egcs compilers and the free portable MPI implementation,
<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/index.html">MPICH</a>.
Currently Avalon is ranked 113 on the November 1998 list of the
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/top500.html">Top 500
super computers</a>.

<p>
In this presentation we discuss the performance and scalability of
an MPI-based implementation of Black-Box Multigrid (BOXMG) for symmetric
positive definite matrices (i.e., discretizations of second-order
elliptic PDEs) on Avalon.  Key factors in BOXMG's efficiency
and robustness are the use of operator-induced interpolation,
which approximately preserves the continuity of normal flux,
and the use of variational coarsening.   This stage of the algorithm is
perfectly parallelized with an overlapping domain decomposition
of the global domain.  In particular, viewed on the coarsest grid
the annulus for a domain of coarse-grid cells need only be one half
cell wide. However for convenience in experimentation with modified
communication schemes (e.g., balance latency and speed of
communication) we use a full cell. The operator on the coarsest grid
is collected on a single processor and solved with serial BOXMG.
We note that the presence of an approximate homogenized coarse-grid
operator is notably absent from most domain decomposition algorithms,
yet it is paramount to the efficiency and robustness of these
algorithms in the presence of fine-scale anisotropic structures.
Unfortunately, in these difficult cases parallel smoothing is the
Achilles heel of robust and efficient parallel multigrid algorithms
In this work we compare alternating zebra Gauss Seidel, in which
the line solves are performed either directly across multiple processors
(e.g., divide and conquer algorithms from
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/index.html">SCALAPAK</a>)
and or iteratively,  with various overlapping domain-colored Gauss-Seidel
relaxations.  In addition, we consider these methods as
preconditioners for conjugate gradient iterations.

Coarsening 3-D Hybrid Meshes for Multigrid Methods

<br>Abstract
</center>
<p>
Multigrid methods have proven robust and efficient to solve large
systems of equations arising from finite volume or finite element
methods. The robustness of the method lends itself very well for the
modeling of complex systems that incoporate physical models that might
be stiff or exhibit poor stability.  Examples of these are turbulence
models, simulations or Large Eddy simulations.  These models often
contain a mix of interface-based fluxes and cell-based integrals or
need the reconstruction of a higher order derivative of the data.
While agglomeration methods for coarsening grids have been very
successful in the application of solving the Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations, they do not lend themselves well as black-box tools for the
complex systems described above: the irregularly agglomerated 
elements do not allow the straightforward implementation of the
fine grid models on the coarser grids.
<p>

As an alternative, Crumpton and Giles [1] have presented an
edge-collapsing algorithm for triangles and tetrahedra. The coarser
levels of these grids are composed of simplex elements and the
discretization of the finer levels can be applied identically, making
this approach ideally suited for black-box multigrid applications.
In the algorighm
the two endpoints of an edge are collapsed onto the midpoint of the
edge, removing all the elements that were formed with that edge and
enlarging all the elements that are formed with one of the endpoints
of the edge. This process is applied sequentially to a set of 
colored edges until a prescribed coarsening ratio is achieved.

<P>
In [2] M&uuml;ller and Giles have set out to develop a
similar algorithm that is able to coarsen hybrid meshes that are
composed of triangles and quadrilaterals in 2D.  Such meshes are often
used to resolve shear layers in viscous flow calculations.  The hybrid
edge-collapsing algorithm of [2] works primarily on the graph of the
mesh. In this graph, any edge can be collapsed if after the collapse
the geometry is still valid and none of the neighboring edges exceeds
a maximum length it has been allowed.  The first criterion is obvious,
we cannot tolerate negative volumes due to folded grids. The second
criterion expresses the design principle of multigrid, usually the
coarse grid doubles the length of the edges in a mesh. Edges are
collapsed in order of their length, the shortest edge is tested for a
possible collapse.  Special care has to be taken to achieve
directional coarsening in highly stretched meshes.


<p>
However, the 3D extension of this edge-based collapsing algorithm 
to coarsen meshes with tetrahedra, pyramids, prims and hexahedra 
proved unsuccessful. The 2D algorithm attempts to collapse one edge
after the other, in the order of shortest length. While a tetrahedron
with a collapsed edge vanishes, all other hybrid element types 
see their volume reduced. Collapsing on edges created coarser grids
with a large number of elements of small volume. In addition, the angularity 
constraint and a possible constraint on twist of quadrilateral faces
made the system much too stiff to achieve any coarsening after one or
two levels.

<p>
Here we propose an alternative to [2] that produces well shaped
elements with an appropriate size on the coarser meshes. We maintain
the two basic ingredients: a collapse is only permissible if the
graph of edges is not overly lenthened and if the resulting geometry
has a tolerable angles. It will be seen that a constraint on twist of
quadrilateral faces is not necessary in practice. The major difference
is that instead of collapsing the shortest edge of the mesh, we
collapse the smallest element of the mesh. An element collapse occurs
with the collapse of a set of edges of an element. E.g. a hexahedron
needs four parallel edges to collapse, in order to disappear. A prism
can either collapse between its two triangular faces having three 
edges collapse or between two quadrilateral faces. Clearly, there are
still partially collapsed elements that share a face or an edge with
a collapsed element. In regular meshes, however, the sorting for 
smallest element most often proposes one of the partly collapsed neighbors
for the next collapse and recovers most of the structure of the 
finest grid. There is no guarantee on the other hand that all partly 
collapsed elements are removed in the process, as can be seen from the
following figures. 

<P>
As a preliminary example, a 17x17x17 regular hexahedral mesh is
collapsed twice from 4096 to 576, resp. 84 elements, 4913 to 792,
resp. 140 vertices.  Boundary effects introduce some irregularity in
the structure, since an edge that is formed with one boundary node is
collapsed onto the boundary, while an interior edge is collapses to
mid-edge. This results in a 'fault-line'of prims with a volume that is
roughly half the volume of the regularly coarsened hexahedral elements
which grew roughly eightfold in size.  The resulting meshes have
maximum angles of < 110 degrees and no twisted quadrilateral faces are
produced.

<P>
We are currently working on an extension of the algorithm to
automatically detect stretched regions of the mesh and apply
directional coarsening as in [2]. The final paper will contain 2-D and
3-D finite volume Navier-Stokes computations on the coarsened hybrid
grids and will assess the efficiency of the method as well as its
sensitivity to parameters such as the permitted elongation of the
edges or the maximum tolerable angles.

<p>
Solutions to 3D geophysical inverse problems are often not practical because
computational run times can be excessive. Thousands of forward modeling
applications, involving hundreds of thousands to millions of field unknowns,
can be required to complete a single 3D inversion of a data set. Moreover,
to arrive at a final model, multiple inversion runs are often needed to
ascertain the correct data weighting scheme and fine tune stabilization
(regularization) parameters, all which are necessary for optimal results.
>From our perspective, a viable attack on the 3D geophysical inverse problem
requires that the number of forward-modeling applications as well as the
computational burden in solving the problem be substantially reduced. In
this paper we explore a variety of  techniques to reduce the computational
run times for the forward problem. Test examples will be drawn from the 3D
electromagnetic scattering problems at discrete frequencies.
Magnetotellurics and induction logging applications will be emphasized.
Numerical solutions to this problem are obtained using finite difference
methods, where the resulting linear system, because of its size, is solved
to some pre-determined error level using iterative Krylov methods. The first
technique to be discussed has been developed to accelerate the convergence
rate at low frequencies and induction numbers by first deflating the null
space of the discrete spatial differential operator. We demonstrate a
reduction of up too two orders of magnitude in the number of iterations and
an order of magnitude speed up needed to solve a series of test problems. We
have also develop some simple relations to show when the preconditioner will
be effective. The second technique, which is a generalization of first, is
to formally expand the solution using Neumann series expansion in terms of
the frequency. Provided this series converges, we can equate powers to
construct multi-frequency solutions where the amount of computational work
is equal to that needed to obtain the highest frequency response. Finally,
the optimal way to combine the series expansion into an efficient Krylov
subspace technique for multiple frequencies, involves the Lanczos algorithm.

<p>
In this presentation we present a multi-level formulation for
transonic flow calculations based on solving the full potential
equation as well as the Euler equations. The goal is to minimize the
overall computation time to simulate steady flows by using a more
computational efficient physical model in the early iteration
steps. In the first level, the full potential model is solved to
obtain a intermediate solution which is "improved", in the second
level, by solving the Euler equations.  The full potential equation
and the Euler equations are discretized on the same unstructured mesh
to simplify the conversion, between the two level, of the potential
variable to the Euler variables. The resulting nonlinear systems are
solved by a Defect Correction method. To demonstrate the feasibility
of this multi-level formulation, we present multi-processor
computational results for three dimensional transonic flows around
nonlifting wings.


<p>
Compressible fluid flow simulations needed for aerodynamic
applications can be modeled with different degrees of complexity. The
simplest model is the full potential equation which assumes inviscid,
irrotational and isentropic flows. This model utilizes a single
second-order nonlinear differential equation that is inexpensive with
respect to the execution time and the memory requirement. Validity of
the full potential equation is, however, restricted. The isentropic
assumption of the potential flow model leads to inaccurate physics for
transonic flows with strong shocks. The next level of approximation is
the Euler equations which describe the complete behavior of inviscid
compressible flows. The Euler model utilizes a coupled system of five
nonlinear differential equations of first order. Finally, the
Navier-Stokes equations include the viscous effects needed for
accurate modeling of the boundary layer. These equations are not only
more time consuming to solve but also require an associated mesh that
is stretched and very fine in viscous regions.  Nevertheless, for
complex flows with separation of the boundary layer, the Navier-Stokes
equations are mandatory to provide an accurate
simulation. Furthermore, for high Reynolds number flows, turbulence
appears and needs to be modeled.  Here we consider exploiting the full
potential model to obtain an intermediate solution which is improved
upon using the Euler model. A natural extension of this strategy is to
utilize the full potential solution as an initial solution for the
Navier-Stokes solver as to obtain the viscous effect. This second
alternative will be considered in future work.


<p>
In the proposed methodology, the Euler model is used, only after
relative convergence of the full potential model, to obtain the
accurate location and the physical representation of the shock and the
entropy it generates. Recall that the isentropic assumption of the
full potential model leads to a shock which is stronger and further
back. For shock free flows the full potential model and the Euler
model give the same result within the numerical discretization
approximation. However, in such flows there is no need to switch to
the Euler model; the full potential solution is correct. Numerically,
it has been observed that a large number of iteration steps are
required for steady Euler solvers to position the shock. Only after,
does the residual start decreasing considerably. By using the full
potential model, the shock is roughly located at a fraction of the
cost and the Euler model just needs to position it to the accurate
location.

<p>
The full potential solver developed uses a finite volume formulation
associated with the same control volume as the Euler solver. The use
of the same mesh saves memory as well as permits easy transfer of the
value of the full potential variable to the Euler variables, i.e. to
the conservative Euler variables namely the density, the momentum and
the energy. Recall, that the full potential model is basically the
conservation of mass while the Euler model is conservation of mass,
momentum and energy. Therefore the fluxes are calculated differently
as well as the upwinding required for each model. The resulting
software is very compact, reusing the same solver strategy which is
based on Defect-Correction Krylov solution strategy. One of the main
difference is that the action of the Jacobian on the arbitrary Krylov
vector for the full potential equation is performed by Matrix-free
Jacobian-vector product based on differencing, whereas for the Euler
solver, a first order Jacobian matrix calculated explicitly in a
classical Roe-type variable decomposition is utilized. Finally, the
steady-state solution is obtained using a pseudo-transient
computation.

<p>
To show the computational gains, the flows over a half geometry of
NACA0012 airfoil extruded in the normal direction to the flow in three
space dimensions is performed at Mach number 0.8. This model problem
is chosen to avoid the implementation of the Kutta condition. Indeed,
this symmetric flow does not create any lift.  The calculations are
performed on multiple processors machines to address problems with a
large number of degrees of freedom. Note that the difference between
the numerical solutions of the full potential model and the Euler
model for subsonic case decreases with the size of the mesh. To
minimize such effects on our transonic computation, a relatively fine
mesh needs to be utilized. In our experience, the implementation of a
full potential solver within an existing Euler solver is relatively
simple; the benefits being that the overall computation time to
compute a transonic solutions can be reduced drastically by exploiting
a first level full potential solver followed by a second level Euler
solver.

<center>Scalable Multigrid Methods Using Fortran 90 and MPI

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Abstract</center>

<p>We outline a strategy for implementing multigrid methods for solving
structural mechanics problems on distributed memory parallel computers
using Fortran 90 and MPI. This produces a portable code that can be executed
on a variety of architectures. We use the multigrid method to solve the
linear matrix equations encountered during the tracing of equilibrium paths
using arc-length continuation methods. This allows us to solve many different
types of nonlinear structural engineering problems. We present some results
obtained on a variety of machines (Origin 2000, Cray T3E, IBM SP2) that
demonstrate the scaleable performance of our parallelization strategy.
<p>Experience teaches that most of the time of a multigrid solution is
spent in computing the product <b><i>Kp</i></b> on different meshes during
the relaxation phase, where <b><i>p</i></b> is the search direction computed
during conjugate gradient relaxation. These computations can account for
as much as 95% of the total CPU time [3]. Therefore, this matrix-vector
multiplication has to be implemented in the most efficient way to ensure
effective parallelization of the strategy. We employ element-by-element
computations to perform this matrix-vector multiplication. This approach
reduces the storage required because no global matrices need to be assembled
and stored. This method uses a node-element domain data structure which
requires gather-scatter procedures [2,5]. Considering the computation of
<b><i>Kp</i></b>,
this matrix-vector multiplication in a single processor environment proceeds
as follows. First, the element version of <b><i>p</i></b>,
<b><i>p</i><sup>e</sup></b>,
is formed by gathering information from the global <b><i>p</i></b> vector.
Second, <b><i>K</i><sup>e</sup><i>p</i><sup>e</sup></b> is computed at
the element level for each element. Finally, the global
<b><i>Kp</i></b>
vector is produced by scattering the element versions of <b><i>K</i><sup>e</sup><i>p</i><sup>e</sup></b>.
Implementation of the element-by-element strategy on distributed memory
parallel machines requires special attention to the gather-scatter operations.
An efficient communications algorithm must be adopted to minimize the amount
of data traveling through the network, thus reducing the total communications
cost. To illustrate our strategy, consider a mesh with one degree-of-freedom
at each node. Assuming a distributed parallel machine with four processors,
four partitions of the mesh are assigned to processors P1 through P4. Each
processor contains the portion of the global vectors (e.g., <b><i>p</i></b>,
<b><i>x</i></b>,
<b><i>r</i></b>, etc.) required by the solution algorithm
associated with the elements assigned to that processor. During mesh generation,
elements are numbered so that they have consecutive numbers in each partition.
Local vectors <b><i>p</i></b> and <b><i>Kp</i></b> are generated on each
processor for each partition, and play a global role for their respective
partitions. The <b><i>Kp</i></b> computation now can be performed as follows:
<ol>
<li>
On each processor, each element of the partition gathers information from
the local <b><i>p</i></b> vector to form the element version of <b><i>p</i></b>,
<b><i>p</i><sup>e</sup></b>.
This involves no communication since no information is needed from other
processors.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<b><i>K</i><sup>e</sup><i>p</i><sup>e</sup></b> is computed at the element
level in each processing node, with no communications required.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
The element quantities are scattered to the <b><i>Kp</i></b> vector for
each partition on each processor; again no communication is required.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
The final <b><i>Kp</i></b> vector for each partition becomes available
after an exchange of information to transmit data between each partition.</li>
</ol>
This approach (similar to a methodology described in [1]) is particularly
effective, since interprocessor communication is avoided in all of the
first three steps. This strategy can be implemented efficiently using MPI
procedures MPI_send and MPI_recv to perform blocked communications. Matrix-vector
multiplications are required in the interpolation and restriction phases
of the multigrid solution algorithm. The matrix is now an interpolation
matrix, <b><i>T</i></b>, or a restriction matrix <b><i>T</i><sup>T</sup></b>
[3,4]. No interprocessor communications are required during interpolation,
which is performed using steps 1 through 3 above. Restriction does require
communication, and follows steps 1 through 4 above. The scalar product
operations (that are part of the conjugate gradient relaxation) also involve
communications since a global sum is required to calculate the final result.
We will have repeated values for the nodes shared by more than one processor.
Therefore, the correct result can be obtained by dividing the values corresponding
to the shared nodes by the number of processors involved, before global
summation. MPI_allreduce is used to combine the scalar products evaluated
for each processor. Other MPI procedures used by our code include MPI_init,
MPI_comm_size, MPI_comm_rank and MPI_finalize.

Hybrid Solvers for the Steady State 
Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p> 

There has been considerable discussion of the relative merits of
multigrid and Newton-based methods for solving the steady state
incompressible Navier Stokes equations.  The full approximation
storage method (FAS) promises cheap iterations and high rates of
convergence, but fast convergence is difficult to achieve without the
correct combination of interlevel transfers and smoothing operations.
While superlinear rates of convergence are attractive, Newton-based
iterations are more expensive, both in terms of operations and
storage.  Further, performance can be sensitive to the choice of an
initial approximation, even with globalization strategies.  Recent
advances in the development of inexact Newton methods have made a
Newton-based approach more competetive, but a good preconditioner is
still necessary to achieve satisfactory performance.

<p>

This debate is largely misdirected.  Since both strategies require
selection of components whose effectiveness is highly
problem-dependent, it is unlikely that one strategy will emerge as the
method of choice for a broad class of applications.  In fact, the two
approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses that can be
exploited to compose efficient and robust solvers.  The expense of a
Newton-Krylov method can be mitigated by using it as the coarse grid
solver for FAS, which will often provide a good initial approximation.
An improved coarse grid solver can also improve the robustness of a
nonlinear multigrid scheme.  Linear multigrid methods can be used as
preconditioners for a Newton-Krylov scheme, whether it is used as a
coarse grid solver or as a standalone solver.  As a standalone solver,
Newton-Krylov schemes with multigrid preconditioning can considerably
enhance the robustness of available smoothers.

<p>

Classical fixed point methods for solving the incompressible
steady-state Navier Stokes equations, such as SIMPLE and SIMPLER, can
be used as multigrid smoothers, and are also effective preconditioners
in a Newton-Krylov scheme.  In this latter context, they have the
additional advantage of requiring no explicit linearization in order
to be effective.  While this presents an opportunity to leverage prior
software investments, some care must be taken in the way these fixed
point methods are deployed in the context of a hybrid solver.

<p>

Even within this framework, numerous questions still need to be
addressed.  What is the best multigrid cycling strategy to use as a
preconditioner?  How accurately should the FAS coarse grid problem be
solved?  What modifications of the fixed point single grid solver are
needed to enhance its effectiveness as a smoother? Where in the grid
hierarchy is the Newton-Krylov method most effective?  What software
components are needed, and how should they be organized, to facilitate
exploration of these issues?  Few analytic results are available to
point to the most effective strategy, but numerical experiments help
to identify fruitful avenues to investigate.

<center>Algebraic Multigrid Methods based on Element Stiffness Matrices

<p>Abstract</center>

<p>In order to solve large, linear, discrete systems with a sparse matrix
structure an efficient solution strategy is required. The AMG method (introduced
by Brandt/McCormick/Ruge) has proven to be an efficient and robust solver
if the system is an s.p.d. M-matrix arising from an FE-discretization.
<br>Unfortunately the "region of robustness" for s.p.d. M-matrices and
general s.p.d. matrices is very fuzzy. For this reason we present two methods
to deal with that problem. Therefore we assume access to the element stiffness
matrices.
<p>First, we present a method to preserve the M-matrix property such that
the best possible spectral equivalent M-matrix to the original one is obtained.
The efficiency of this technique is shown for anisotropic rectangles with
bilinear FE-functions. AMG, with the spectral equivalent M-matrix with
respect to the original stiffness matrix, is then applied as a preconditioner
to the CG method.
<br>In this case we can show numerically the robustness of this technique.
Unfortunately the method will not work for triangles or tetrahedra.
<p>Second, we suggest a method which acts locally on element patches.
<br>Therefore, we use the Schur-complement on such local patches. Then
it is straightforward to obtain&nbsp; overlapping coarse grid operators
and locally defined prolongation operators. With this technique we also
get a kind of patch structure on the coarser levels. Thus the the algorithm
can be applied recursively. We think that this method behaves also very
robust, but it is not longer depending on the M-matrix property.
<br>Finally numerical results are shown.

A Serendipitous Recovery of Linear Scaling

<p>
Quite often serendipity is associated with small and large
discoveries in science.  Here we describe a small occurrence 
associated with the algorithmic scaling of a multigrid algorithm
when solving a nonlinear PDE.  In particular, we are solving
the equations of radiation transport in the diffusion limit.
In providing results in support of a recent paper, a curious result
was obtained: when solving the equations in their standard linearized
discrete form for a time-dependent problem with multigrid suboptimal
algorithmic scaling was found.  This could largely be attributed to
the time step control mechanism which effectively changed the time
step size linearly with grid dimension while an explicit diffusion
time step control would change the time step size quadratically.
Thus the problem becomes increasingly ill-posed as the grid is 
refined.  

<p>
As fate would have it we were also interested in solving the full
nonlinear problem in this paper.  We employ the same multigrid 
algorithm mentioned above as a preconditioner for a Newton-Krylov
method.  When solving the same problems as above and employing the
same time step control we observe linear scaling, or we recover
the desired result.  
When holding the Fourier number constant, the multigrid algorithm
produces linear scaling (N raised to the 1.01 power), but for small
and larger time step sizes (based on 10 and 50 percent relative
energy change), the powers raise to 1.14 and 1.22.  With the nonlinear
algorithm these scalings reduce to a power of 1.05, very nearly linear.

<p>
Here, we examine our good fortune.  Philosophically one might simply
observe that the nonlinear solution method provides a truer 
representation of the physical problem.  Indeed such scaling may simply
be the result of solving a wave phenomena in a fashion more in
keeping with its physical nature.  This is in opposition to solving it
as a sequence of parabolic problems while treating the time step size
as if it were a wave problem.  While all these observations have merit,
the differences between the two solution algorithms are not large, the
preconditioner for Newton's method is the solver used for the linearized
equations and the only contact with the nonlinear problem is the matrix
vector multiply in the Krylov (GMRES) algorithm.  Nevertheless the
result seems significant when considering the ultimate efficiency of 
solving time-dependent physical problems and delivering the full 
promise of multigrid, linear algorithmic scalability. In addition
the full nonlinearly convergent algorithm produces results that have
the design accuracy of the numerical scheme.

<p>
A current application problem for Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) involves two
or more elastic bodies in contact along parts of their surfaces. The
elastic bodies can be irregularly shaped and the discretization can use
unstructured finite element meshes. AMG was seen as a promising
approach, since it has been shown to work well in some elasticity
problems, and is able to handle domain and mesh irregularities.

The interfaces (or "slide surfaces") between the bodies can be modelled
in several possible ways. The main approach considered in the
application code for specifying the slide surfaces was to introduce
additional constraints there. Within the applications code, an outer
iteration is performed, in which it is determined which grid points from
one surface (the "slave" side) are in contact with the other ("master")
surface. The approximate locations of contact are also computed, and
used to determine weights of interpolation from the master nodes to the
slave nodes, and approximate normal directions to the surface.  With
these weights and directions frozen for the iteration, a linear system
of equations is assembled that models the elastic behavior of the
system.  An additional set of constraints is introduced which states
that, along the interface, the slave nodes lie on the master surface
(although they can slip in a tangential direction). This can then be
viewed as a constrained minimization problem (since the elasticity part
of the problem is minimization of a functional). The Lagrange
multipliers introduced can be viewed as forces at the slave nodes. An
alternative view is to introduce forces at both slave and master nodes,
and impose both the non-penetration constraints at the slave nodes, and
force-balance equations at the master nodes. With the proper transfer
of forces from the slave to master nodes, followed by explicit
elimination of the master forces, the two systems are identical. The
system is symmetric, although indefinite. The diagonals for the
constraint equations are zero. That is, in a "natural" association
of equations and unknowns, it makes sense to say that the non-
penetration constraint at a slave node corresponds to the Lagrange
multiplier (or force) introduced there, although it does not appear
in its own equation.

Indefiniteness and zero diagonals both pose difficulties for AMG. In
tests, a straightforward application of AMG to this system did not
converge well, and at times diverged.  However, in test cases it was
found that a special relaxation sweep along the slide surface took care
of both problems. In this relaxation, the displacements at a particular
master node, along with the displacements and forces at nearby slave
nodes, were relaxed simultaneously. This appeared to keep error in a
subspace for which the problem was definite. In fact, the convergence
per cycle of this method was nearly identical to that obtained when AMG
was applied to the elasticity problem alone (simply discarding forces
and interface constraints).

In this talk, the method will be given in more detail, and experimental
results will be presented.

<strong> 
ARMS : an Algebraic Recursive Multilevel Solver for
General Sparse Linear systems

This paper introduces  a multilevel  iterative algorithm  for  general
sparse matrices called   the  Algebraic Multilevel  Recursive   Solver
(ARMS).  ARMS is an algebraic multi-grid  like algorithm in the spirit
of the classical  AMG of Ruge  and Stuben in  that it does  not
require   an  underlying grid, or   set  of grids  for determining the
restriction and   prolongation operators.  Instead,  generalized  grid
transfer  operations based on the elements  of  the coefficient matrix
are  used.     One characteristic of   the  method   is that   it uses
preconditioned Krylov subspace methods for solving the coarse problems
that arise at the last level, or at the intermediate levels, Thus, the
method   is  applicable  to  general  sparse   matrices.   Much of the
convergence  theory developed for the   standard methods relies on the
matrices being symmetric and cannot be easily extended to ARMS.
<p>
The construction  phase of  the preconditioner involves  computing the
restriction   and  prolongation  operators   between   levels,  and an
incomplete LU  decomposition of the last  reduced system.  These steps
are similar to as those described in the BILUTM algorithm [Saad-Zhang,
1998].  They  are based on finding  an independent set  first and then
constructing a (2,2) block LU factorization. The (2,2) part of the
U-matrix in the block-factorization is the Schur complement system.
This matrix is again sparse because of the block-diagonal
structure of the (1,1) block. This approach is similar to others
which exploit block-elimination methods [Axelsson-Vassilevski 90,
Reusken 97, 98, Saad-Zhang 98, + others..]. However one distinction
is that it is applied recursively with the inclusion of a 
interlevel (Krylov subspace) solve for each level - which 
uses the block factorization for preconditioning. 
<p>
Thus, the solution process  is implemented similar  to a classic V  or
W-cycle, except that the number of visits to the  coarse levels is not
necessarily predetermined.   There are mainly  two sets  of variations
within the method.  The first set is roughly analogous to a V-cycle: A
set of  forward  solves are implemented,  the   coarse system is  
<i>solved</i>, followed by  a set of  backward solves.  The coarse system is
solved  iteratively,   using  GMRES   preconditioned  with    the  ILU
factorization of the last  system.  The last  system can be solved  as
accurately as desired.
<p>
Another set of variations within the general scheme is more similar to
a W-cycle, except that for more than a few levels, the shape may
become complex to visualize. 
The idea is that an iterative solve may be performed at any level in
the preconditioner.  The ``Recursive'' term used to name the algorithm
refers to the fact that 
level i+1 acts as a preconditioner for level i, which in
turn is serving as a preconditioner for level i-1, and so on.
To be more precise, the preconditioner for the full original system 
A0 
can be viewed as a forward solve, followed by solution of the system A1
and a backward solve.  The system A1 is solved iteratively with GMRES.
The preconditioner for A1 is a forward
solve, followed by solution of A2 and a backward solve.  This process
proceeds until the last level, where the preconditioner is simply a forward
and backward solve using the ILU factorization computed in the construction 
phase.
<p>
One aspect of  the method that is   investigated is how  matrix-vector
products  may be  computed during  the  iterative  solves on different
levels.  The simplest solution is to store the reduced systems Ai
for i=1,...,N  at each level.    This  can lead  to excessive   memory
requirements, and the    Schur  complement matrices  computed  in  the
construction of the preconditioner may not be completely accurate.  We
discuss  a technique for  performing  the matrix-vector products which
does not  require storing the  reduced systems, and which often yields
convergence in fewer iterations.  A drawback  is that the computations
become expensive for large systems.
<p>
There are many parameters involved that need to be fine-tuned.  We
present a few general rules and suggest ways  in which good parameters
may  be determined.  If enough  fill is allowed   in the first pair of
grid transfer  operators, and enough iterations   are performed on the
coarser levels, it  is possible  to get  complete convergence in   one
outer iteration.  However, this is usually not the quickest procedure,
and,  in fact, can  become  prohibitively expensive for large systems.
Numerical results are presented  comparing iteration counts  and total
solution times for different numbers of levels, and varying parameters
within ARMS, and between ARMS and some other methods.

<p>
Algebraic multi-grid (AMG) methods haven proven to be relatively robust black-box solvers with optimal
complexity <em><b>O(N)</b></em> for systems of <b>N</b> linear equations.
Therefore the implementation of AMG methods on parallel computers
is of great interest. However, the straight forward parallelization of AMG,
i.e. the concurrent computation of coarse grids and interpolation for subsets of unknowns
on multiple processors is very difficult due to the lack of geometric information
about the underlying continuous problem (PDE, boundary conditions and domain) and its discretization.
There are several approaches to deal with this problem. However, to some extent, all of them give up
the pure algebraic and black-box character of AMG by the use of additional geometric information.<br><br>

An approach which does not sacrifice the algebraic and block-box character for the sake of
parallel computation is the combination of AMG with a graph partitioning (GP) algorithm.
This seems to be a very natural unification of algorithms, since AMG and GP are
closely related.
We use the GP software package <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/">METIS</a> to partition
the set of unknowns. This induces a block structure on the matrix and may be regarded
as an algebraic counterpart of classical domain decomposition methods for geometric MG.
Then, the following three different algebraic solver variants may be considered:
First we can use an additive Schwarz method (in combination with a Krylov method)
with internal AMG solver for every diagonal block of the block structured matrix.
The second variant is the use of a Schur complement method with internal AMG solver.
Finally the direct parallelization of the AMG method applied to
the block-structured matrix can be considered.<br><br>

Typically the problem of load balancing is not an easy task for multi-level
applications. Here, it is especially difficult since AMG does construct its
own coarse grids which may generate an unbalanced number of levels on each processor.
These three different parallelization approaches have their own distinct advantages and
disadvantages with respect to load balancing and communication. 
We discuss their main properties and compare their parallel performance,
i.e. parallel efficiency, complexity and robustness, on our cluster 
<a href="http://wwwwissrech.iam.uni-bonn.de/research/projects/parnass2/">Parnass2</a>
and a Cray T3E for a variety of elliptic PDEs of second order.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
Multi Coarse correction with Suboptimal Operators (MCSO) method was
presented at Copper Mountain conference on iterative methods in 1998.
The method was extensively tested on scalar problems that covered different
numerical difficulties such as large jumps
in coefficients, high anisotropy or non symmetry of resolved matrix.
The results were encouraging. Now MCSO is extended to vector problems arising in
Computational Fluid Dynamics.

<p>

MCSO method belongs to the family of multigrids using matrix dependent
prolongation operators. The main innovation of this method is the
construction of such operators by minimizing Frobenius norm of
the matrices corresponding to different coarse grids under a constraint
on patterns of the operators. For 5-diagonal matrices in 2D case, the
minimization problem can be solved analytically which reduces
considerably the amount of numerical work required to build coarse
operators.

<p>

The extension of the proposed method to vector problems is
straightforward. The numerical experiments concern the solution of
Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in 2D case on grids with high
aspect ratio. MCSO is used as linear solver at each Newton iteration.
A satisfactory linear convergence was observed. Nevertheless the non
linear convergence might be significantly slower even in advanced stage
of calculation. This lack of convergence speed is probably due to the
fact that the matrix corresponding to the finest level is computed "on
the fly" only approximatively. However, even with this limitation the
CPU time for solving a given test problem remains reasonable and is
obviously far better than plain application of a smoother on the finest
level.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<br>Solving distributed linear systems requires a preconditioner that not only 
improves the convergence properties but also maintains a good parallel 
efficiency 
of an iterative solution method. Parallel linear system solution 
is usually based on the domain decomposition framework in which equations 
and unknowns are partitioned to processors resulting in a block-structured 
linear system.
Many parallel preconditioning techniques exploit this block structure.
The simplest of these techniques, Additive Schwarz, though
easy to implement and subject to little parallel overhead, may fail to
converge for   difficult   linear systems and  for   large  numbers of
processors.  On the other  hand, when the  Schur complement related to
the  original global  system is  considered,  parallel iterative methods
can be developed whose convergence properties do not deteriorate [1, 2, 3]
In general, the related Schur  complement system  is  better conditioned 
than  the original system, and it is often  beneficial to obtain the solution 
to the   original system by solving the    Schur complement system.
Constructing and solving the Schur complement system exactly is rather 
expensive.
This  is especially true   in
distributed environments, where the communication overhead is added to
the overall cost. 

<br> An earlier work [4] proposed several preconditioners using 
Schur complement iterations
without forming the Schur complement system meaning
that each  processor performs operations only on  its local portion of
the global Schur complement  matrix. This is accomplished by utilizing
the distributed data  structure for the  original matrix.  The cost of
solving the  Schur   complement   system  is kept  minimal   by  using
approximations of the local Schur complements and by solving inexactly
the  global Schur  complement system. 

<br> The conducted numerical experiments have indicated 
that the developed Schur Complement preconditioner
outperforms the standard Additive Schwarz preconditioner.
Nevertheless for the proposed
preconditioner, the iteration numbers grow noticeably with the increase in
the problem size and processor numbers and thus hinder the efficiency 
of the preconditioner.  One possible cause is that
the Schur Complement iterations use Additive Schwarz as a preconditioner.

<br>Here we propose a two-level strategy to precondition the Schur 
Complement system:
a reduction of the Schur Complement system to the a system having only 
selected interface 
points. In a sense, solution with these points,  can be viewed as a 
coarse grid solver.  In constructing the reduced system we 
still avoid forming a global system  explicitly and utilize the same
(fixed) communication pattern as used for the original system.
Inexact solutions of the
Schur  complement system and its reduced system are obtained   by  a small
number  of  GMRES steps.

Radiation Transport equations arise in the study of many different
fields such as combustion, astrophysics and hypersonic flow.

<p>
As a first approach to understanding these equations we consider the
case where all energies are in equilibrium. Such a case can be modeled
by a single non-linear partial differential equation. One of the
interesting properties of this equation is the large jumps in
coefficients which are a consequence of material inhomogeneity.

<p>
In this talk, we consider the performance of three different solution
techniques on this problem. The techniques are Newton/Multigrid,
Newton/DOUG and FAS. The DOUG package is a domain decomposition package
written by Graham et. al. at the University of Bath.

<p>
The results from this initial study will be incorporated into a project
which is designed to efficiently solve more general Radiation Transport
equations (without the assumption that the energies are in equilibrium)
on ASCI teraflop-scale machines.

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The numerical resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs)
frequently requires the solution of linear systems.
Among iterative methods
to solve these linear systems, multilevel schemes are often the
most efficient (often an order of magnitude faster than non-multilevel
schemes). While they have been successfully used in many disciplines,
the widespread use of multigrid methods has not been witnessed due, in part,
to implementation difficulties, especially for problems with unstructured
grids, irregular boundaries, and complex physics and chemistry.  Moreover,
the construction of the coarse grids and their operators may not be
straightforward for many applications.  For these reasons, multigrid
methods are often difficult to implement, difficult to incorporate
into applications, and are consequently rarely found in large
complex application codes.
<p>
To address the complexities of multigrid research, we are constructing a
multilevel software module that incorporates a wide variety of methods. It is
extremely important to carefully design the framework and corresponding
interface so as to facilitate use by application engineers and to be able to
easily capture and incorporate recent advances in multilevel methodologies.
The principal difficulty in designing a user-friendly multilevel framework
stems from the close relationship between applications and multilevel
methods. Specifically, many multilevel schemes require a great deal of
information from the application (e.g. a hierarchy of grids, boundary
information, grid transfer information, etc.).  This implies two difficulties
in generating multilevel software: 1) how to avoid overwhelming application 
engineers with a large number of multigrid details, 2) how to efficiently 
extract information which is stored differently within each application?
To address the first point, we believe that application engineers can work
with a multilevel module in a progressive way. Starting with schemes that
require little application information or naturally extending simpler methods
(e.g. converting one-level domain decomposition to two-level domain
decomposition preconditioning), an application
engineer can become familiar with a modest number of multilevel issues.
If the initial scheme does not satisfactorily solve the problem of interest,
multilevel methods requiring more interaction with the application can be
progressively pursued. The key is that a common multilevel framework helps
engineers explore different methods in a systematic way.
To address the second point, good object oriented software design
principals must be adopted.
Data structure independence (or neutrality) helps alleviate the nuisance
of matching data structures provided by users and those understood by
the multilevel module.  This feature is implemented by requiring users
to supply functions which access their user-defined data structures.
For example, grid information (e.g. coordinates, connectivity, etc.)
needed by the module is generally available within most finite element codes.
However, the specific data structure used within these
codes will surely vary from application to application. Thus, instead of
requiring users to conform to a specific data structure, applications
are only required to provide a pointer to their data structure as well as
a standard set of functions to access them.  This standard
set of functions should already be in place in most finite element codes.
The only additional work is to re-package them to match the simple calling
sequences in the multilevel interface.
<p>
In this talk we focus on three very different multilevel schemes:
standard geometric multigrid, agglomeration multigrid, and two level
domain decomposition.
These three schemes represent major trends in multilevel
methods and were strongly motivated by the needs of different
application engineers. For example, recently several complex engineering
codes have started to include h-adaptivity into their grids.  While providing
grid hierarchies and grid transfers was difficult for these complex codes in
the past, their new h-adaptive capability makes it fairly straight-forward to
provide an entire grid hierarchy as well as grid transfer operators. For
these codes,  a standard geometric multigrid solver is now within reach.
Of course, while h-adaptive codes have increased dramatically in recent
years, the majority of application codes still have limited capabilities for
processing several grids at the same time.  For most complex codes,
agglomeration techniques are more desirable than geometric methods
as the coarse grids, grid transfers, and coarse grid discretizations are
generated automatically.  Unfortunately, robust general purpose agglomeration
techniques do not yet exist (though improvements are still continuing in this
active research area). Another possibility is a two level domain decomposition
method. While
difficult to generate an entire hierarchy, it might not be so difficult to
generate two grids, especially if the grid transfer and coarse grid
discretizations could be provided by the software module. Additionally, most
non-multilevel parallel solvers are already doing some type of one-level
domain decomposition.  Thus, the addition of one more grid in the computation
is often quite natural and not too cumbersome for most applications.
<p>
A number of multigrid issues are discussed for the various algorithms
including: interface issues, passing grid information between finite element
applications and the multilevel module, forming grid transfers in parallel,
solving the coarse grid problem, handling different boundary conditions, and
matching the fine and coarse discrete operators.
The relatively user-friendly interface is demonstrated by coupling
the multilevel module with an iterative solver package, Aztec,
and a finite element chemically reacting flow program, MPSalsa.
Numerical results are given for several fluid flow problems on the
Intel Tflop machine demonstrating the numerical advantages of the different
multilevel schemes.

Waveform relaxation is an iterative method for solving systems of 
ordinary differential equations.  The  method extends classical 
iterative methods (such as Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, multigrid, 
GMRES, etc.) to function spaces.  The iterates are a sets of 
continuous or discretized functions, instead of sets of scalar variables.
Besides offering the potential for good parallel performance, this method 
also proves to be easy to implement.  So far, the method has been applied 
primarily to solve ordinary differential equations, possibly obtained 
by semi-discretization from a time-dependent PDE.
The convergence theory of the method for that type of problem is
nowadays very well understood.
<p>
Recently, however,  the method was applied to delay differential equations, 
or, more generally, functional-differential equations.  Such equations arise 
for example in population dynamics, and in the study of nonlinear materials
with memory.  Earlier studies concentrated on simple Jacobi- and Gauss-Seidel
type iterations.  In this seminar we will concentrate on the multigrid
acceleration of those methods.
<p>
First the type of equation that is consider will be defined.  It will be
shown that delay partial differential equations exhibit quite different
stability characteristics than classical partial differential equations.
Then, the application of waveform relaxation and its multigrid
acceleration will be illustrated by means of a number of  examples.
Finally, the convergence of the method will be  studied by using a Fourier 
analysis technique, which takes the interaction of error smoothing and
coarse grid correction into account.
Numerical results will be supplied to illustrate the theory.

The purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the smoothed

principles, and a convergence theory for elliptic problems and their 
singular perturbations. The new convergence bounds
for a method which alows more usual coarsening by a factor of 2 in each

and Ales Janka.)
Further, we demonstrate certain 
self-homogenization effects of the smoothed aggregation coarsening and
show their application in theory for problems with jumps in coefficients
(that is currently under investigation together with Marian Brezina, 
Caroline Heberton and Nicolas Neuss). We also describe a generalization

<p>
The usefulness of sparse approximate inverse preconditioners in parallel
computing environments has motivated much interest in recent years. However,
the capability of approximate inverses in eliminating the local
errors has not yet been fully exploited in multi-grid algorithms.
A careful examination of the iterative matrices corresponding to these
approximate inverses indicates their effectiveness in smoothing the
high frequency error in addition to their inherent parallelism.
We propose a new class of sparse approximate inverse smoothers in this talk
and present their analytic smoothing factors for constant coefficient PDEs.
The several distinctive features to make this technique special are:
<ul>
<li> By adjusting the quality of the approximate inverse, the smoothing
     factor can be improved accordingly. For hard problems, this is very
     useful.
<li> In contrast to the ordering sensitivity of other smoothing techniques,
     this technique is ordering independent.
<li> In general, the sequential performance of many parallel algorithms is
     not very competitive. This technique is useful both in parallel and
     sequential  computations.
</ul>
Our theoretical and numerical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this new technique.

A parallel implementation of the finite volume method
for three-dimensional, time-dependent,
thermal convective flows is presented.
The discretization equations derived from the scheme, including
a pressure equation which consumes
most of computation time,
are solved using a parallel multigrid method. A flexible parallel
code has been implemented on distributed-memory and share-memory systems
by using domain decomposition
techniques and the MPI
communication software. The code can use 1D, 2D
or 3D partitions according to different geometries. It currently runs
on the Cray T3D, T3E , the IBM SP2, the HP/Convex SPP2000,
and the Beowulf cluster system; it is easy to be
ported to other parallel systems which support MPI software.

<p>

Numerical results are obtained for
Rayleigh numbers up to 5x10^7  and for a
Prandtl number 0.733 equivalent to that of air, in a
cubical enclosure, which is heated
differentially at two vertical sidewalls.
Separations of the flow near the horizontal walls occur,
and y-variations of the flow are strong. Periodical flow patterns appear.
The 3D solutions for such high Rayleigh number
5x10^7 become strong
convective, time-dependent, and periodical. In addition to studying
side-heating convective problems, the present 3D code is ready to explore
Rayleigh-Benard flows, rotation flows, and other problems.
Some numerical results for these studies are also discussed.

Nowadays, it has become popular to study the convergence of multilevel 
methods and to use them in combination with a Krylov subspace acceleration 
method, in other words to use multilevel methods as a preconditioner. 
Often, the cycling in a hierarchy of grids is simplified compared to standard
multigrid cycling, i.e. the multiplicative cycling between the fine and 
coarse grids is replaced by an additive (simultaneous) cycling. It is then
necessary to use this additive method as a preconditioner to obtain a 
converging method even for simple problems. <br>
Recently, standard (multiplicative)
multigrid methods ([Bra77], [Hac85]) have been used as a preconditioner as well.
This application of standard multigrid is beneficial in situations where 
standard multigrid alone does not converge fully satisfactorily, because
certain error frequencies are not reduced well enough. This occurs mainly
when complicated PDEs are solved. In general, it is difficult to construct
robust multigrid solvers for large classes of problems. From this point of view,
it makes sense to increase the class of problems for which proven efficient
multigrid solvers exist by accelerating (standard) multigrid by a Krylov
subspace method. Among many other papers, this approach has been presented in
[Ket82], where  a symmetric multigrid method was accelerated by CG, in [Bra95Mi]
for problems  with fine level structures, in [Oos96W] for linear singularly
perturbed problems and in [Oos98W] for nonlinear problems.<br>
In this talk we theoretically analyze one combined solution method,
 restarted GMRES,
GMRES($m$), preconditioned by multigrid. We derive quantitative convergence
results. The basis for the theoretical convergence estimates is Fourier 
analysis, which is a well-known tool for obtaining two-grid convergence factors
([Bra77], [Stu82T]). 
Fourier analysis uses unitary basis transformations to simplify the
representation of the two-grid iteration matrix. It is therefore suitable for
the estimate of the multigrid preconditioned GMRES($m$) convergence since
unitary transformations do not affect the convergence behavior of GMRES
 [Saa86S].
The typical use of the two-grid Fourier analysis in a
multigrid context is that the spectral radius is obtained theoretically. 
It is the basis for asymptotic multigrid convergence estimates [Stu82T].
Furthermore the whole spectrum of the two-grid iteration matrix is easily
calculated from the Fourier analysis.
A preconditioned Krylov subspace acceleration method like GMRES($m$)
implicitly builds up a minimal residual polynomial. The determination of the
polynomial coefficients is easily possible and can be done explicitly, since
a block diagonal matrix results with the help of the Fourier analysis.
Based on the GMRES($m$) polynomial, sharp theoretical convergence estimates
can be obtained which are compared with estimates based on the spectrum of
the iteration matrix. <br>
We restrict ourselves to standard problems coming from scalar
linear PDEs discretized with finite differences on uniform Cartesian grids
and we keep the multigrid method simple. For example, we restrict ourselves
to point smoothers combined with standard grid coarsening and analyze the effect
of Krylov subspace acceleration for anisotropic diffusion problems and for
problems  with mixed derivatives, although it is known that other (more 
expensive) smoothers or other coarsening strategies are appropriate remedies
for the poor convergence of such equations. In this way we gain insight in the
behavior of the combination of multigrid and GMRES($m$).<br>
Several numerical tests compare the theoretical convergence estimates with the
actual numerical convergence.<br><br>

<p>
We present nonlinear solvers for variably saturated porous media
flow problems.  In particular, we consider the set of nonlinear
equations arising from a finite difference discretization of the
time-dependent Richards' equation.
The solvers use a Newton-Krylov approach for handling the nonlinearities

and apply multigrid as the linear system preconditioner.  Multigrid
is used in an attempt to achieve scalability. As both the problem size
and
the number of processors grow in tandem, one would like both algorithmic

scalability (multigrid convergence factors remain essentially constant)
and
implementation scalability (time for a single multigrid iteration
remains
essentially constant).

<p>
We compare the effectiveness of two multigrid preconditioning
algorithms in the context of large-scale, three-dimensional domains
with heterogeneous, discontinuous permeability fields.  First,
we examine a semicoarsening multigrid algorithm
(PFMG, Ashby and Falgout, 1996) utilizing point smoothers.
Second, we look at a semicoarsening multigrid algorithm
(SMG, Schaffer, 1998) employing plane smoothers.
In general, the PFMG method requires less work
per iteration than the SMG algorithm; however, PFMG is not as robust
in the context of heterogeneous domains.  In this talk we will look
at cases where each algorithm has its advantages
and disadvantages and try to summarize when one algorithm may be
preferable to the other.

<p>
The need to solve linear systems arising from problems posed on
extremely large, unstructured grids has sparked great interest in
creating a scalable parallel algebraic multigrid (AMG) algorithm. Much
of AMG can be parallelized in a relatively straightforward fashion,
using well-known technology from parallel geometric multigrid
methods. For example, the entire "solver" phase of the AMG algorithm
can be written so that the only parallel tools required are the
matrix-vector multiply (capable of handling rectangular matrices and
multiplication by the transpose) and the coarse-grid solver.
<p>
In the setup phase, however, the "classical" AMG algorithm selects
the coarse-grid points in a manner that is inherently sequential, and
no scalable way of parallelizing it is known. Without scalable
parallel coarse-grid selection algorithms, coarse-grid selection could
entail a significant fraction of the total effort, even to the point
of dominating the computation time.
<p>
Recently we implemented <i>BoomerAMG</i>, a parallel AMG code. We have
performed the parallel coarsening in a variety of ways. In one method,
for example, the coarse-grid selection is based on a well-known
parallel algorithm for finding maximal independent sets.  However, the
measures for assessing C-point candidates are modified during the
selection by applying certain heuristics.  These rules are designed to
insure coarse-grid quality by honoring the relationships of the
independent variables to each other. Another approach is to perform
the sequential coarsening algorithm independently on each
processor. In this approach some special action must be taken at
processor boundaries to insure consistency in the coarse-grid
definition.  This approach also suffers in that it generates different
grid-hierarchies for different numbers of processors on the same
problem.
<p>
We discuss theoretical considerations, implementation strategies, and
experimental results for various parallel coarsening strategies. In
particular, we discuss the effect of the coarsening algorithm on the
convergence factor for several types of problems.  Along with
implementational scalability, we are interested in attaining algorithmic
scalability of the convergence factor, so that it remains essentially
constant at some reasonable value as problem size and the number of
processors increase.

<br>Abstract

<p>
Systems of partial differential equations are often difficult to solve 
numerically. Frequently, numerical solvers are far more efficient and 
easier to apply if the system is reformulated by applying a carefully 
chosen differential operator on the left (pre-conditioning) or on the 
right (variable transformation), resulting, for example, in a 
decoupled or locally weakly-coupled system (that is, with a triangular 
principal part). Such a representation may also be useful in gaining 
insight into the properties of the system, and it may also allow 
treatment of different components of the system by different numerical 
techniques.

Such analysis is often difficult to perform for complicated systems,
and it is easy to overlook interesting options. Hence, we attempt to
automate this procedure. We describe a code, written in MATLAB (using
MAPLE for many symbolic manipulations), which accepts a linear 
partial differential operator and outputs a LATEX file containing the
various ways found in which the system can be triangularized without
violating certain imposed constraints (e.g., the operator must remain
of the same type).

<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
We introduce a domain based multilevel block incomplete LU
preconditioner (BILUTM) for solving general sparse linear
systems of the form <B>Ax = b</B>, where the coefficient matrix A
is unstructured. This preconditioner combines a high accuracy
incomplete LU (ILU) factorization with an algebraic multilevel 
recursive
reduction.  We first search for a block independent set among
the vertex set such that the nodes between the blocks are not
coupled, but the nodes within each block may be coupled. Then
the coefficient matrix  is permuted  into a
two by two block  form   using  the (block)  independent   
set  ordering  <br>
<p>
<center>
<table border>

<tr><td> E <td> C
</table>
</center>
<p>
where D is a block diagonal matrix.
A partial ILUT (ILU with a double dropping
strategy)
factorization for the   reordered  matrix is performed.  
The novelty of the proposed multilevel
preconditioning technique is the
way that the reduced (coarse level) system is constructed.
<p>
The ILUT factorization is first performed to the upper half
(D F) of the permuted matrix. Due to the block structure of the
upper part submatrix this part of the ILUT factorization 
can be performed in parallel with respect to individual
blocks. Then the factorization is continued to the lower
part (E C) of the matrix. However, eliminations are only performed
to the nonzero elements corresponding to the nodes in the
independent set. In other words, only the nonzero elements in
the E submatrix are eliminated. Appropriate linear combinations
are performed to the elements in the C submatrix corresponding
to the eliminations of the nonzero elements in the E submatrix as
in the standard Gaussian elimination process.
Note that the eliminations with respect to
individual nodes can be performed simultaneously since all
nonzero elements (in the E submatrix) eliminated correspond to 
the nodes  in the independent set (in the D submatrix).
<p>
With this partial ILUT factorization, the
right corner submatrix C is changed into an approximate
Schur complement of the permuted matrix. Thus, the reduced 
(coarse level) system is then defined as the approximate 
Schur  complement associated with the block independent set
partitioning and it 
is obtained  implicitly as  a byproduct of   the
partial ILUT factorization with respect to the complement of the
independent set without explicit matrix-matrix multiplications.
The incomplete factorization process 
is repeated with the reduced systems 
recursively. The last  reduced system is factored
approximately using ILUT again.
<p>
Interlevel transfer operators that are analogous to those in
algebraic multigrid method can be defined to show that the
multilevel preconditioning
operators satisfy the Galerkin condition. In fact, certain form
of block LU factorization can be written to show the
link between BILUTM and algebraic multigrid method.
<p>
On each level, the ILU factorization of the submatrix D and
the interlevel transfer operators are stored one followed
by another, level by level, in a long vector. However, the coarse 
level systems on any levels are computed, used, and discarded.
<p>
The preconditioning operations consist of level by level forward 
elimination, the coarsest level approximate solution, and level by
level backward substitution.
<p>
The differences between multilevel preconditioning technique
and algebraic multigrid method include different choices of the
coarse level nodes and different concept of smoothing or
relaxation on coarse level systems. These issues will be
discussed.
<p>
The proposed implementation is efficient in controlling  the fill-in
elements  during  the multilevel block  ILU factorization, especially
when large  size  blocks are  used   in  domain  decomposition  type
implementations. Both the preconditioner construction and
preconditioning application have high level inherent 
parallelism within each level.
<p>
Numerical experiments are used to show the robustness
and efficiency of  the proposed technique  for 
solving  some difficult problems. Comparisons between single
and multilevel ILU preconditioning techniques will be
reported.

Abstract </P></CENTER>

<P>Subspace correction methods are techniques for the numerical solution
of equation systems which arise in the discretization of partial differential
equations. Here, the function space in which the solution is sought in
is decomposed into several smaller spaces. The framework of subspace correction
schemes contains both classes of optimal and almost optimal order iterative
solvers, multilevel and domain decomposition methods. Furthermore, the
efficient solution of boundary value problem requires adaptive grid refinement
in order to reduce the number of unknowns of a discretization for a prescribed
tolerance. In addition, it requires the use of parallel computers. However,
the efficient parallelization of a code with adaptive grid refinement,
where workload is created locally during the computation, is difficult.
This is especially true in the presence of optimal and almost optimal subspace
correction solvers, because the load-balancing and administration overhead
must not exceed the ordinary computation time. </P>

<P>A parallel version of multiplicative multigrid usually is based on a
partition of all nested grids. The domain is decomposed into several sub-domains,
which induces partitions of all grids. Each processor holds a fraction
of each grid in such a way that these fractions of each grid form a nested
sequence. Hence each operation on a specific level is partitioned and mapped
to all processors. Furthermore the communication during grid transfer operations
is small because of nested sequences on a processor. This means that one
has to treat global problems on each level, which are partitioned to all
processors. The intra-grid communication has to be small, that is the number
of nodes on the boundary of the partition should be small. Furthermore
the amount of work on coarse grid levels usually is small and each processor
does not compute much. There are several strategies to deal with the coarse
grid problem in general, such as to centralize the computation on a master
processor, to perform identical computations on all processors or to modify
the coarse grid correction step. </P>

<P>In contrast to the geometry or domain oriented parallelization of multiplicative
multigrid methods, the additive multigrid version or additive multilevel
preconditioners can be parallelized in a more flexible way. The overall
workload has to be partitioned, but we do not have to consider individual
levels. Here, also the communication takes place in a single step for all
nodes, which are located on the boundary of at least one grid of the nested
sequence. The straightforward implementation is similar to the implementation
of a multigrid V-cycle. However, the implementation with optimal order,
which we will present, is similar to the hierarchical basis transformation
and requires one auxiliary vector. Two loops over all nodes are necessary,
one for the restriction operation and one for the prolongation operation.
They can be both implemented as a tree traversal. However, by iterating
over the nodes in the right order, two ordinary loops over all nodes are
sufficient, one forward and one backward. </P>

<P>We report on experiments with the implementation of the additive preconditioner
in an adaptive, parallel, distributed memory programming environment. The
data is addressed by keys, stored in hash tables and is dynamically partitioned
by a Hilbert space-filling curve. These methods guarantee the optimal order
of the implementation, where usually sub-optimal graph partitioning heuristics
dominate the overall complexity and run-time. We will address this parallel
dynamic load balancing and mapping problem. Numerical experiments for two
model problems, namely Poisson equation and Lame equation of linear elasticity
on several parallel computers will demonstrate the scalability of this
approach and conclude the presentation. </P>
