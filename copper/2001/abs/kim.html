<p>
We consider a mixed finite element method for a model second anisotropic 
elliptic equation on the unit square \Omega of the following form

<pre>
	- ( p_xx + \eps p_yy ) = f  in \Omega,
	                     p = 0  in \Gamma,
</pre>

where \Gamma is the boundary of \Omega and \eps is a small constant.
We study a multilevel preconditioner for this problem on uniform 
rectangular and triangular meshes. 
<p>
We use a two-level result by Bramble, Pasciak, and Zhang [East-West J.
Numer. Math., 4 (1996), pp.99-120], in which no approximation or regularity
conditions are required.  Our "coarse" level problem will be the finite
element problem on the same mesh as in the mixed finite element problem.
<p>
In the rectangular case, we use the Schur complement of the mixed problem
at the "fine" level.  A mesh dependent form is used in the analysis and 
implementation.  In the triangular case, we take the equivalent 
nonconforming finite element problem to the mixed finite element problem
as the "fine" level problem.  In both cases, line Jacobi smoothers are
used to effectively reduce the error in the "fine" level.
