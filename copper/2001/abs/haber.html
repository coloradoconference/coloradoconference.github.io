Abstract </p>

<p>The problem of recovering a parameter function based on
measurements of solutions of a system of partial differential
equations in several space variables leads to a number of
computational challenges. Upon discretization of a regularized
formulation a large, sparse constrained optimization problem is
obtained.<br>
Typically in the literature, the constraints are eliminated and
the resulting unconstrained formulation is solved by some variant
of Newton's method, usually the Gauss-Newton method. A
preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is applied at each
iteration for the resulting reduced Hessian system.<br>
<br>
In this talk we apply instead a multigrid method directly to the
KKT system arising from a Newton-type method for the constrained
formulation (an ``all-at-once'' approach). Since the reduced
Hessian system presents significant expense already in forming<br>
a matrix-vector product, the savings are substantial.<br>
<br>
Numerical experiments are performed for the DC-resistivity
problem in 3D, comparing the two approaches for solving the
linear system at each Gauss-Newton iteration and a substantial
efficiency gain is demonstrated.<br>
The relative efficiency of our proposed method is even higher in
the context of inexact Newton-type methods, where the linear
system at each iteration is solved less accurately. . </p>
