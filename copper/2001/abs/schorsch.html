<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The standard FOSLS Method only works well if the exact solution of the problem
is in H^2. For many practical applications of Stokes or Elasticity this is not
true (Mixed BCs, reentrant corners, etc.). In our talk we present the FOSLL*
Method, which is an FOSLS-like method,
constructed to overcome this drawback.

We will present numerical results for Stokes and linear Elasticity, which
show optimal FE- and MG-convergence of the method.
