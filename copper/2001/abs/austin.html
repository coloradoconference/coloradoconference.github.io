<p>
An effective multilevel solver for (I - grad div) must account for the
presence of divergence-free error components.  As a result, the Raviart-Thomas
(RT) finite element spaces, with locally computable divergence-free 
subspaces, are often used in the discretization of (I - grad div).  
The presence of an epsilon-sized Laplacian term, leading to (I - 
eps*Laplacian - grad div), results in poor approximation properties for the
discontinuous RT finite element spaces.  With a new continuous, RT-like
finite element space, we can define a multilevel solution algorithm which
achieves optimal convergence factors.  In this talk, we will present numerical 
results validating our claim and introduce theory to firmly establish the 
algorithms effectiveness.
