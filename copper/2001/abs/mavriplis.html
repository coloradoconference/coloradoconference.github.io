The relative efficiency of an unstructured multigrid
algorithm used as a non-linear solver (FAS)
is compared with the efficiency of the equivalent
multigrid algorithm used as a linear solver
on a Newton linearization of the non-linear problem,
and with the efficiency obtained
using either approach as a preconditioner
for a non-linear GMRES method.
Two types of problems are examined,
the solution of a transient radiation diffusion
problem, and the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.
In the first case, the discretization employs
a nearest neighbor stencil and the linearized scheme
operates on an exact Newton linearization.
In the second case, the discretization is based
on a second-order form which involves neighbors of neighbors
while the linearization employed is based on a first-order
accurate nearest-neighbor stencil.
For the radiation diffusion case, the linear multigrid
approach is more efficient than the FAS approach,
mainly due to the expense involved in the more frequent
computation of the highly non-linear residuals required
in the non-linear multigrid case.
When the linear system is solved to sufficient
tolerance, quadratic convergence of the non-linear problem
is observed.
For the Navier-Stokes equations, quadratic convergence
of the non-linear problem is not possible, since an
inexact linearization is employed.
While a linear multigrid iteration is shown
to be substantially cheaper than the corresponding
non-linear multigrid iteration, the relative performance
of both methods depends largely on the tolerance
to which the linear system is solved, and the achievable
non-linear convergence rate.
Using either method as a preconditioner
rather than as a solver is also shown to provide
additional convergence acceleration.
Other issues such as memory requirements
and robustness of the various schemes will also be discussed.
