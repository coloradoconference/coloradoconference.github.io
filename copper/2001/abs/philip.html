<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The talk will describe current ongoing work on developing elliptic solvers on adaptively refined
curvilinear coordinate grids. First-Order System Least-Square formulations are used for elliptic
systems to facilitate the development of reliable local error estimators. These error estimators will
be used to determine where to place local fine grids during the adaptive mesh refinement process. 
The class of Fast Adaptive Composite Grid (FAC) algorithms will be described. Details of 
implementing AFACx, an asynchronous version of FAC, on adaptively refined  
curvilinear grids will be described.
