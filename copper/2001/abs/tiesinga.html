<p>
The 1994 discovery by P. Shor of a polynomial quantum factoring
algorithm has started initial efforts into the development of quantum
computers.  This opened new avenues of research for mathematicians,
computer scientists, and physicists alike.  The quantum paradigm of
computing induced renewed interest in complexity classes, (quantum)
error correction, searches for other algorithms, and the search for
physical implementations of the basic building blocks, such as qubits
and quantum gates, of a quantum computer.
 
<p>
We have applied multigrid methods to solve for a two-dimensional
Schr&ouml;dinger equation in order to study the feasibility of a quantum
computer based on extremely-cold neutral alkali-metal atoms.  Qubits are
implemented as motional states of an atom trapped in a single well of
an optical lattice of counter-propagating laser beams.  Quantum gates
are constructed by bringing two atoms together in a single well leaving
the interaction between the atoms to cause entanglement.  For special
geometries of the optical lattices and thus shape of the wells, quantifying
the entanglement reduces to solving for eigenfunctions of a Schr&ouml;dinger
equation that contains a two-dimensional Laplacian, a trapping potential
that describes the optical well, and a short-ranged interaction potential.
 
<p>
Length and energy scales of the trapping potential and interaction
potential are too disparate to allow for a naive discretization of
the differential operator. The size of the resulting linear systems would
prohibit reasonable calculations. An adaptive grid approach automatically
finds a spatial representation that is refined when the atoms are close
together and the interaction potential is very strong and is coarse
at larger separation where the trapping potential is the largest
energy scale.  The finite element discretization of the Schr&ouml;dinger
equation on this grid produces an eigenproblem with the matrix
<em>A</em><SUP>-1</SUP><em>B</em> where <em>A</em> is the usual finite
element discretization of a second order linear elliptic operator and
<em>B</em> contains the <em>L</em><SUB>2</SUB> inner products of the
finite element basis functions.  Selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors
are computed by an iterative method that requires only multiplication
of a vector by the matrix.  Multiplication by <em>A</em><SUP>-1</SUP>
is achieved by solving a linear system with the matrix <em>A</em> by a
multigrid method.
