<a name="14"><h2>STUDENT PAPERS</h2>
Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to student
authors judged to have the best research papers.  Papers
containing original research due mainly to the student must be
received before Dec. 15, 2000.  They must be singly authored and
may be no more than 10 pages in length. Sending only
an abstract is unacceptable.  A panel of judges will determine
the best papers.  Authors of the best papers will
be given a travel stipend, free lodging, and registration, and
each will be expected to present their paper in one of the regular
conference sessions. 
We will also provide some support for up to five more
students who submit acceptable papers.
Student papers should be submitted as ps files by
<a link href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">e-mail</a>.
If this is not possible, a hard copy of the paper may
be submitted by regular post to:
<pre>
CMCMM01
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO
DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATH
CAMPUS BOX 526
BOULDER CO 80309-0526

<p>
Postdocs 
are not considered "students" for this competition--nor are they eligible
for student registration fees.
