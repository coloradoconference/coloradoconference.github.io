<h4 align=center>Room Sharing Bulletin Board</h4>

We have a bulletin board so you can leave
messages about sharing rooms at Copper Mountain.
The theory is that you can use this system to
post your needs and questions about room-sharing
so that other attendees can respond.  We take no
responsibility concerning the contents of any
message on the bulletin board. In addition, the
bulletin board may be cleared out without
notice.
