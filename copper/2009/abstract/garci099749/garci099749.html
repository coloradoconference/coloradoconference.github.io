<BR><EM>National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).Multigrid solvers are considered to be the most efficient methods to solve
many classes of numerical problems.  However, the true performance of these
methods depends on their specific implementations for different
computer architectures.  In recent years the continuing increase in single
threaded microprocessor performance has stalled as designs have become
bound by fundamental limitations with the underlying device physics.  These
limitations have ushered in a new era or multi-core, many-core, and heterogenous
core processors, aimed at increasing speed through explicit parallelism. For
Multigrid algorithms to benefit from this recent trend they must be able to
