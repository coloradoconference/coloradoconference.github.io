<P>
Algorithmic choice is essential in any problem domain to realizing
optimal computational performance. Multigrid is a prime example: not only
is it possible to make choices at the highest level, but a program can
switch techniques as the problem is recursively attacked on coarser grid
levels to take advantage of algorithms with different scaling behaviors.
Additionally, users with different convergence criteria must experiment
with parameters to yield a tuned algorithm that meets their accuracy
requirements. Even after a tuned algorithm has been found, users often
have to start all over when migrating from one machine to another.

<P>
We present a programming language and autotuning system that addresses all 
of these issues in a near-optimal and efficient fashion.
The freedom of
independently tuning both the algorithm and the number of iterations at
each recursion level results in an exponential search space of hybrid
algorithms that have different accuracies and performances. To search
this space efficiently, our autotuner utilizes a novel dynamic
programming method to build near-optimal hybrid algorithms from the
bottom up. The result is a tuned hybrid algorithm that invests minimal
targeted computational power to yield the accuracy required by the user.

<P>
The techniques we describe allow the user to automatically generate tuned
"W-cycles" of different shapes targeted to the user's specific
combination of problem, hardware, and accuracy requirements. These cycle
shapes dictate the order in which grid coarsening and grid refinement are
interleaved with both iterative methods, such as Jacobi or Successive
Over-Relaxation, as well as direct methods, which tend to have superior
performance for small problem sizes. The need to make choices between all
of these methods brings the issue of variable accuracy to the forefront.
Not only must the autotuning framework compare different possible W-cycle
shapes against each other, but it also needs the ability to compare
W-cycles against both direct and (non-multigrid) iterative methods. We
solve this problem by using accuracy as a measure for the effectiveness
of tuned W-cycle shapes and making comparisons over all algorithmic types
based on this common yardstick. In our results, we find that the
flexibility to trade performance versus accuracy at all levels of
recursive computation enables us to achieve outstanding performance on a
variety of platforms compared to algorithmically static implementations
of multigrid.

<P>
Our implementation uses PetaBricks, an implicitly parallel programming
language where algorithmic choices are exposed in the language. The
PetaBricks compiler uses these choices to analyze, autotune, and verify
the PetaBricks program. These language features, most notably the
autotuner, were key in enabling our implementation to be clear, correct,
and fast.
