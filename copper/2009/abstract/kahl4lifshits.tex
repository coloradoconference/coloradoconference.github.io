To guarantee efficient performance of algebraic multilevel
methods for solving the eigenproblem Bx = x in Markov
Chain applications, we are using an adaptive setup that
captures the nature of the eigenmode of interest. The
least-squares based approach computes appropriate testfunctions
and fits them to define highly accurate interpolation
that leads to a robust multilevel performance.
The algorithm iteratively improves the ability of the multi-level
approximation To the lowest mode of interest until it can be efficiently
resolved using this hierarchy as preconditioner to an additive GMRES step.
We test the proposed approach for a variety of applications, showing promising
results over a wide range of tests.
