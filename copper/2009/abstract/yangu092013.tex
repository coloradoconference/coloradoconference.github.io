Aggressive coarsening has been a very effective tool to reduce
computational complexities as well as memory requirements in algebraic
multigrid, however it requires an interpolation operator that deals
effectively with the long distances between coarse grid points. Usually
aggressive coarsening is combined with multipass interpolation, an
interpolation based on direct interpolation, which leads to deteriorating
convergence and decreased numerical scalability.

Various new long range interpolation operators based on distance-two
interpolation operators, which have a higher of accuracy than direct
interpolation, are investigated. This presentation describes the
resulting algorithms, their convergence behavior, and analyzes their
performance on parallel computers.
