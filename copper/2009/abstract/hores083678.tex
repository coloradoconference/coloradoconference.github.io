In this study an OcTree discretization for Maxwell’s equations is
proposed. This discretization is based on an explicit construction of the
adjoint of the curl operator. As opposed to the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ local
accuracy offered by the transposed curl operator, this non-symmetric
construction offers local accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(h)$, which is more
favorable. We explore several adaptive refinement criteria, and discuss
their effectiveness.
