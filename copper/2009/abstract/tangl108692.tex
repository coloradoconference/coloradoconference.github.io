A new adaptive local refinement strategy (ACE), in which the refinement
decisions are based on optimizing the
computational efficiency, has recently been developed. The first-order
system least-squares (FOSLS) finite
element methods, together with algebraic multigrid methods (AMG),
complement this idea, resulting in a powerful tool for numerical
solutions of many PDEs. However, in parallel environment, the global
sorting of element local error indicators used by the original approach
results in undesirable communication between processors. A strategy
circumventing the global sorting is proposed. The test results show that
the strategy has the potential of greatly reducing communication, while
producing a sequence of refined grids with essentially the same quality
as before.
