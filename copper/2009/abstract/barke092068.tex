Simulation of fluid-structure interaction is a complex problem that
involves modeling different physics for the fluid and the structure and
coupling them together in a stable and efficient manner, and developing
scalable numerical methods for this highly nonlinear problem is a
computational challenge. Here we develop and test parallel, scalable
techniques in the multilevel Newton-Krylov-Schwarz family for solving the
nonlinear, monolithically coupled fluid-structure interaction system on
dynamic moving finite element meshes in the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
framework. We develop and numerically evaluate parallel nonlinear and
linear grid-sequencing techniques and linear multilevel preconditioners
for the monolithically coupled problem with fully implicit time-stepping,
compare these results to the corresponding one-level algorithm, and
present applications of the method to the simulation of blood flow.
