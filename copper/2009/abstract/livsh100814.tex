A new multigrid solver for finding many eigen functions of the 2D
Schrodinger operator is discussed. The solver employs multiscale
eigenbasis whcih means an accurate representation of the finest-grid
problem by an increasingly larger set of increasingly smaller eigen
problems as the solver proceeds to coarser grids.
Finally, on the coarsest grid many eigen problems, each of size $O(1)$,
solved, collectively producing accurate approximations to all finest-grid
eige pairs. The algorithm is built in an adaptive algebraic framework,
using Brandt's least squares approach for prolongation operators, and
Galerkin method for building coarse-grid operators.
