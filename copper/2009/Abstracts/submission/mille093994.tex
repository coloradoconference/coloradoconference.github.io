An algebraic multigrid (AMG) method is presented for the calculation of
the stationary probability vector of an irreducible Markov chain. We
propose a modified AMG interpolation formula, which produces a
nonnegative interpolation operator with unit row sums. It is shown how
the adoption of a lumping technique maintains the irreducible singular
M-matrix character of the coarse-level operators on all levels. Together,
these properties are sufficient to establish the well-posedness of our
algorithm. Numerical results show how our method leads to nearly optimal
multigrid efficiency for a representative set of test problems.
