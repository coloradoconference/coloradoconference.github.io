===ABSTRACT:
We develop  an algebraic analysis of two-grid methods that does
not require any symmetry property. Several equivalent expressions are provided
that characterize {\em all} eigenvalues of the iteration matrix. In the
symmetric positive definite case, these expressions reproduce the
sharp two-grid convergence estimate obtained by Falgout, Vassilevski and
Zikatanov [Numer. Lin. Alg. Appl., 12 (2005), pp.~471--494], and also
previous algebraic bounds
which can be seen as corollaries of this estimate.

 These results allow to measure the convergence by checking ``approximation
 properties''. In this talk,  proper extentions of the latter
 to the nonsymmetric case are presented. Sometimes approximation properties
for the symmetric positive definite case are summarized in
loose terms; e.g.: {\em Interpolation must be
  able to approximate an eigenvector with error bound proportional to the size
  of the eigenvalue}  [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 22 (2000),
  pp.~1570--1592]. It is shown that this can be applied 
to nonsymmetric problems too,
understanding ``size'' as ``modulus''.

Eventually, an analysis is developed, for the nonsymmetric case, of
the theoretical
foundations of ``compatible relaxation'', according to which a
Fine/Coarse partitioning may be checked
and possibly improved.
