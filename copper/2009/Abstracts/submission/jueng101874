===ABSTRACT:
An interesting problem from the field of computer vision
is reconstruction of piece-wise smooth functions from
noisy and incomplete data. The problem is more difficult
than reconstructing smooth functions and algorithms 
typically employ an iterative relaxation method as a
component.

We studied a particular algorithm, published twenty years
ago by Leclerc [1], which reconstructs two-dimensional,
piece-wise polynomial functions from noisy data. An
objective function is derived from the premise that a
description of the data in terms of a piece-wise polynomial
signal plus noise from some known stochastic process is
more likely to be correct the shorter it is. The objective,
f, is not continuous and thus difficult to optimize.

Leclerc devises a continuation method by which a sequence
of tentative solutions is sought, solutions corresponding
to a sequence of smooth objective functions converging
to f. For each step of the continuation method Leclerc
uses the Jacobi method to relax the most recent tentative
solution on the linear system that results from setting 
the gradient of the next objective in the sequence to zero.

In our experiments it turned out that Leclerc's algorithm
finds satisfying solutions only for small problem sizes
and performs poorly with realistic sizes. In several
variations of Leclerc's continuation scheme we substitute 
other methods for the Jacobi relaxation to remedy the poor
performance. In particular, we substitute a Conjugate
Gradient method, an inexact Newton method, and a multigrid
Gauss-Seidel relaxation method.

In this presentation we briefly review Leclerc's work and 
give a picture of the difficulties we encountered with 
larger problem sizes. We sketch our variations of Leclerc's
continuation algorithm, present results for each method and
discuss their merits and shortcomings in terms of accuracy,
computational efficiency, and amount of work required
for their implementation.
