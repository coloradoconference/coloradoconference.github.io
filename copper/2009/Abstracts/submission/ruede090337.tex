The most efficient multigrid algorithms known require less than 30
operations per unknown to solve the 5-point stencil discretization of the
Poisson equation in 2D to the level of truncation error. This uses full
multigrid and a clever implementation of an FAS-like scheme using
hierarchical basis transformations.
We will briefly review the features of this algorithm will also discuss its
generalizations for other problems. Unfortunately, the real performance
of multigrid algorithms on current computer systems is much lower than
predicted by such work estimates. We will discuss why this is the case,
and what can be done about it.
