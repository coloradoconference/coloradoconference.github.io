===ABSTRACT:
In this study an OcTree discretization for Maxwell’s equations is proposed. This discretization is based on an explicit construction of the adjoint of the curl operator. As opposed to the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ local accuracy offered by the transposed curl operator, this non-symmetric construction offers local accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(h)$, which is more favorable. We explore several adaptive refinement criteria, and discuss their effectiveness.
