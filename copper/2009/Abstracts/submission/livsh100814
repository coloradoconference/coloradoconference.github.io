===ABSTRACT:
A new  multigrid solver for finding many eigen functions  of the 2D Schrodinger operator  is discussed.  The solver employs multiscale eigenbasis whcih means an  accurate representation of the finest-grid  problem by an increasingly   larger set of increasingly smaller eigen problems as the solver proceeds to coarser grids. 
Finally, on the coarsest grid many eigen problems, each of size $O(1)$, solved, collectively producing accurate approximations to all finest-grid eige pairs.    The algorithm is built in an adaptive algebraic framework, using Brandt's least squares approach  for  prolongation operators, and Galerkin method for building coarse-grid operators.
