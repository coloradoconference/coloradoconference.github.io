Multicore computer architectures present new challenges to linear
solvers, including algebraic multigrid multigrid. The advent of many
cores has effectively increased the imbalance between node compute power
and off-node communication throughput. In this talk we report on our
experiences using nonstandard smoothed aggregation multigrid on multicore
architectures to address the computation/communication imbalance.
Specifically, we consider the case of multigrid with domain decomposition
smoothing, where the domains are allowed to cover more than one core in a
compute node. We'll present numerical results on thousands of processors.
