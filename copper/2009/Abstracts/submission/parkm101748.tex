In this talk we discuss the perfomance of new least squares based
algebraic multigrid method which is modification of Brandt's Bootstrap
AMG(BAMG). Solving the linear system using least squares based AMG
requires set of vectors that are results of several fine level relaxation
sweeps on homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$. Unlike Brandt's BAMG, new method
approximate all F-F connections in least squares sense. The presented
numerical experiments demonstrate that the method can achieve good
convergence with less vectors and relaxation sweeps.
