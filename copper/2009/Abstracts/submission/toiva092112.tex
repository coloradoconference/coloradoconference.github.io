An algebraic multigrid approximation of the inverse of the physically
damped operators is used as a preconditioner for time-harmonic scattering
problems in fluids and solids. The AMG uses graph based coarsening
together with underrelaxed Jacobi smoother. Several numerical experiments
demonstrate the behavior of the method in complicated two-dimensional and
three-dimensional domains. The number of iterations behaves roughly
linearly with respect to the frequency. This approach leads to efficient
solution procedure for low and medium frequency problems.
