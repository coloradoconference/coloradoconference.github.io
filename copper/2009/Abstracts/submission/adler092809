===ABSTRACT:
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is a single-fluid theory that describes Plasma Physics.  MHD treats the plasma as one fluid 
of charged particles.  Hence, the equations that describe the plasma form a nonlinear system that couples Navier-Stokes 
with Maxwell's equations.  To solve this system, a nested-iteration-Newton-FOSLS-AMG approach is taken.  The goal is to determine the most efficient algorithm in this context.  One would like to do as much work as 
possible on the coarse grid including most of the linearization.  Ideally, it would be good to show that at most one 
Newton step and a few V-cycles are all that is needed on the finest grid.  This talk will develop theory that supports 
this argument, as well as show experiments to confirm that the algorithm can be efficient for MHD problems.  Currently, a reduced 2D time-dependent formulation is studied.  These equations can simulate 
a "large aspect-ratio" tokamak, with non-circular cross-sections.  Here, the problem was reformulated in a way that is 
suitable for FOSLS and FOSPACK.  This talk will discuss two test problems from this formulation: the Tearing Mode instability and the Island Coalescence Instability.
