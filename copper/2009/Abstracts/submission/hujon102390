===ABSTRACT:
Multicore computer architectures present new challenges to linear solvers, including algebraic multigrid multigrid.  The advent of many cores has effectively increased the imbalance between node compute power and off-node communication throughput.  In this talk we report on our experiences using nonstandard smoothed aggregation multigrid on multicore architectures to address the computation/communication imbalance.  Specifically, we consider the case of multigrid with domain decomposition smoothing, where the domains are allowed to cover more than one core in a compute node.  We'll present numerical results on thousands of processors.
