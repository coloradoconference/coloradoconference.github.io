<p>
We propose and analyze sparse approximate inverses as smoothers for
multigrid methods. The sparse approximate inverse preconditioners
are inherently parallel and have been shown to be effective for a wide
variety of matrices. But for matrices arising from differential
equations, they may not be as efficient as methods like multigrid.
Parallelization of multigrid methods, however, is still an open issue.
Among other things, there is a lack of effective parallel smoothers.
Our idea is to combine the advantage of the two techniques and obtain
a parallel and effective iterative method. We show theoretically and
numerically that sparse approximate inverses are effective as smoothers
for multigrid. A preliminary numerical comparison with standard
relaxation smoothers are presented.
