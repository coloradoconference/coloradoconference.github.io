Abstract:
 <p>
Factorized sparse approximate inverse preconditioners  
can be sensitive to the ordering of the unknowns. This sensitivity 
can be exploited to decrease the amount of fill-in in the approximate
inverse factorization, and/or to increase the amount of parallelism
available in the construction of the preconditioner. The question is,
how does the ordering of the unknowns affect the rate of convergence
of the preconditioned iteration? To get some insight, we 
experimented with different reorderings and partitioning strategies 
on a number of test matrices from several application areas. 
<p>
In particular, we considered symmetric orderings for sparse direct solvers, 
and nonsymmetric orderings aimed at producing matrices with a zero-free
diagonal. We also considered reorderings induced by some basic graph 
partitioning heuristics. While our main focus was on the factorized 
approximate inverse strategies based on conjugation, we also experimented with 
methods based on Frobenius norm minimization and on bordering. 
<p>
In this talk we report on the results of our experiments, which show that
the robustness and performance of sparse approximate inverse preconditioners
can be significantly enhanced by reordering the coefficient matrix. 
We make recommendations
on which reorderings should be used, and which are likely to give poor results.
We contrast the situation for factorized approximate inverses with 
that for ILU-type techniques, and we offer some simple graph-theoretical
arguments to help explain the results of our experiments.
