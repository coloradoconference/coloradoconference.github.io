Title:  The Linear System Analyzer: A Prototype Distributed Component System
<br><br>

Abstract:
 <p>
Choosing a solution strategy for solving large sparse linear systems in
realistic applications is still an art form.  For every currently existing
solution method, an application area can be found which gives linear
systems that make the solver fail by requiring too much memory or from
nonconvergence.
<p>
Finding a solution strategy for an application still relies heavily on
experimentation and exploration.  Unfortunately, not all computational
science and engineering research projects can have a numerical linear
algebraist on the team.  The LSA is a problem-solving environment for
application scientists who wish to quickly experiment with a variety of
solution strategies and methods for large sparse linear systems of
equations, without having to integrate large amounts of disparate code into
their application.  Once an effective solution strategy is developed, the
LSA provides source code that can be integrated into the user's application.
<p>
The LSA allows a user to<br>
 o Create a solution strategy without knowing the implementation
       details of the computational routines.<br>
 o Navigate a potentially large parameter space quickly, with
       expert advice supplied by the LSA when needed.<br>
 o Analyze and compare results from multiple solution strategies.<br>
 o Encapsulate a solution strategy as exportable Fortran/C code which
       can then be incorporated into an application code.
