Title:  The DOE-Wide Common Component Architecture Working Group

Abstract:
 <p>
Providing modern numerical techniques to large-scale applications is
an increasing problem being faced by developers of numerical software.
A number of research groups have found component-based design to be
effective in managing this complexity.  Fueled by the DOE2000
initiative, which aims at promoting more interaction among software
efforts, an interest has grown in coordinating such tools.  Since the
promise of component technology is to interoperate easily with tools
that provide similar functionality, the CCA working group represents a
next step in exploring this direction.  We will give examples of some
tools currently in use and under development by members of the CCA
working group, and we will discuss issues and trade-offs in
performance and reliability for numerical components.
