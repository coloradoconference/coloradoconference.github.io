Abstract:
 <p>
Much research in sparse approximate inverse preconditioning is
converging to triangular factorized forms.  A new method for computing
these factors based on bordering will be presented and evaluated.
Compared to other methods, the new method is both more parallel and
offers the possibility of updating the sparsity pattern of the
approximate inverse dynamically.  Issues including approximate
inverse structure prediction and the smoothing property of
approximate inverses will also be presented.
