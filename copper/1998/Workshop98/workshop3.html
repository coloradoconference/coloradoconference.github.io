Discussion abstract.
<p>
The BLAS Technical Forum is having its next meeting at SGI/Cray Research
in Minneapolis from April 27th to 29th.  It is hoped that a document 
describing the "new" BLAS can be finalized within
two or three more meetings and that the proposed standards will be adopted
widely.  Since both dense and sparse BLAS are heavily used by the iterative
methods community, we feel that this is a good opportunity to discuss these
issues and provide input to the ongoing discussions.
<p>
The main aspects that the Forum is considering are: parallel BLAS, functional 
extensions to the existing dense BLAS, mixed precision BLAS, C, C++ and 
F90 bindings, and sparse BLAS.
<p>
The sparse BLAS are organized at two levels, a User Level that has a simple
and standardized interface, and a Toolkit level that implements the kernels
for a specific data structure.
<p>
Although this is a discussion session that will primarily rely on comments
and contributions from the floor, the organizers will introduce the topic.
Any attendee is welcome to present a prepared contribution and, to facilitate
the scheduling of the evening, prospective contributors should contact
