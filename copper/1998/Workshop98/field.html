<CENTER>Abstract</CENTER>


<P>We have shown previously that the Factorised Sparse Approximate Inverse
(FSAI) preconditioner proposed by Kolotilina and Yeremin is an excellent
parallel preconditioner. The preconditioner gives significant improvements
in the performance of the iterative solver and the preconditioner has excellent
parallel scalability. However the number of iterations to solve some problems
is still large so there is room for improvement. Therefore, in this paper
we investigate ways of improving the performance of this preconditioner
by using various different sparsity patterns for the preconditioner and
by using different renumbering strategies for the unknowns.
