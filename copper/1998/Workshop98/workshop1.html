Component Frameworks and Solver Interoperability Requirements

Workshop Summary:
<p>
A key difficulty in developing usable software systems for iterative
methods and large-scale linear system solvers is the need to interact with
other parts of applications codes. At the same time, modern research
applications have become by necessity multidisciplinary, requiring the
expertise of several researchers to develop, use, and analyze results.
Component systems are an important new software concept which have
revolutionized the desktop computing world, and they have the potential to
ease scientific computing software development while broadening its 
applicability.  The usefulness of component systems for large-scale scientific 
computing will only be limited by the ability of the components to have an 
extensible set of interfaces.  This would allow, for example, experts in 
finite-element discretization to develop their codes independently of experts 
in large-scale iterative solvers, as long as the resulting components have 
the ability to find or even dynamically negotiate interfaces between 
themselves.

<p>
One force behind the development of component architectures for scientific
computing is the DOE ASCI project, and currently the DOE labs are
developing the mechanisms for component interoperability.  This workshop
will briefly present the ASCI projects, showing why they are converging
towards component frameworks.  A prototype distributed component system for
analyzing and solving large-scale sparse systems will be shown as an
example of how such systems work, and their potentials which extend beyond
ASCI problems.
<p>
This workshop will solicit discussion and ideas for the all-important issue
of specifying component interfaces.
