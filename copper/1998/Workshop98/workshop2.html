Workshop Summary:
<p>
     Recently, the subject of approximate inverses (AI) has attracted new
     attention. Many new developments show the promise of this 
     technique. The motivation for this renewed interest is largely from
     parallel processing. However, new progress in this subject has
     provided an extra boost. The new preconditioners are useful
     in some areas where ILU preconditioners failed. A new class of
     powerful smoothers using AI for multigrid has been developed. The
     understanding of this technique has reached a new level
     in the past 10 years. AI is successfully applied to some challenging
     industrial applications. In this workshop, we present some of the latest
     developments in these directions.
