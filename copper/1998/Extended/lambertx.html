Since the late 1950s, alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods have been 
used for modeling diffusive heat transfer and analogous physical processes.  
In most cases, ADI has been applied to problems with uniform orthogonal grids 
(UOGs), due to directional operator splitting.  Based on UOGs, 2D Peaceman-Rachford 
ADI and 3D Douglas-Brian ADI are second order accurate in space (and time when 
modeling time-dependent linear diffusion).   With appropriate time-step adaption,
these implementations require as few as O(logN) iterations to converge to steady
state solutions over N unknowns.  They also exhibit good parallel scalability 
down to fairly small numbers of unknowns, using spatial domain decomposition.  But 
since UOGs are incompatible with most ways of resolving multiple spatial scales, 
ADI has fallen to the wayside of less spatially structured discretizations on top 
of Krylov and multigrid iterative linear solvers.

However, it should be realized that UOGs are only a subset of the grids on which 
ADI can be defined.  ADI discretizations and iterations can be defined for 
locally refined orthogonal composite grids (LROCGs) as well.  This could 
significantly benefit many LROCG block-structured AMR simulations of diffusive 
processes.

Conceptually, local refinement merely increases the complexity of the line-
solves in ADI.  In particular, a graph showing interdependence of unknowns 
along a particular direction is no longer simply-connected.  Such graphs take on 
topologies resembling vascular capillaries.  For one of the simplest conservative 
spatial discretizations, traversal of a coarse-fine boundary into the finer region 
links the coarser unknown by matrix coefficients to r^(d-1) finer unknowns, 
assuming the same refinement ratio (r) for the (d) dimensions of space.  However, 
the finer unknowns at the boundary are not linked by matrix coefficients to one 
another.  The spatial accuracy for such a coarse-fine discretization is reduced to 
first order, but the linear system of equations for the capillary requires few 
more FLOPs than a compact tridiagonal system with the same number of unknowns.

In particular, for N "capillary" unknowns and a fixed number of refinement 
levels, ADI still takes only O(N) FLOPs.  However, for efficiency, the solvers 
require a carefully structured and sufficiently general Gaussian elimination 
algorithm greatly exceeding the complexity of the compact tridiagonal algorithm.  
For this reason initial studies of LROCG ADI might use almost any iterative 
solvers for the capillaries.  In particular, the Portable Extensible Toolkit 
for Scientific Computations (PETSc), is being investigated due to parallelizability. 

Overall parallelism of a block-structured AMR based on ADI should not be
significantly degraded from UOG ADI once direct capillary solvers commensurate
with spatial domain decomposition are implemented.  These direct capillary 
solvers might explicitly take advantage of block-wise homogeneous and particular 
solutions to diminish serial bottlenecks.  Whether such direct solvers are 
actually necessary is to be determined.

This presentation should illuminate:  time-dependent accuracy and steady-state 
convergence properties of LROCG ADI, discretization error differences between LROCG 
and UOG ADI, and preliminary code timings and timing estimates for LROCG ADI.
