Abstract </p>

<p>In this study we will focus on the performance of the Schwarz alternating procedure
with the use of the polynomial preconditioning conjugate gradient method, as an internal
solver, to solve the linear system generated from the discretization of the self adjoint
problem, defined over an overlapped domains by the explicit group 2 of a five molecular
scheme and the generated linear system for each overlapped domain is of a sparse block
structure, A<img src="pi.gif" width="12" height="10" alt="pi.gif (844 bytes)" align="top">
property and <img src="pi.gif" width="12" height="10" alt="pi.gif (844 bytes)"
align="baseline"> consistently ordered.</p>

<p>The considered discretization for the self adjoint problem was successfully performed
with five or nine molecular schemes to solve the generated linear system using the PCG
algorithm, but in this study the preconditioning of the conjugate gradient is defined by a
polynomial preconditioning by performing few inner iterations according to Eisenstant's
procedure set up by a vectorizable SSOR preconditioning with different consideration of
the diogonal entries.</p>

<p>For comparison purpose a couple of model problems are considered with a vario
us size of
overlapping domain <img src="omega.gif" width="10" height="13" alt="omega.gif (852 bytes)"><small>1
</small>and <img src="omega.gif" width="10" height="13" alt="omega.gif (852 bytes)"><small>2
</small>ranging from <em>h </em>to almost a complete overlapping.</p>
