In the list of papers that we will eventually post, we will

the abstract as the speaker along with a
link to the email address used in the submission.
This year we are allowing authors to submit html versions of
their abstracts, in which case symbols should not be used, or at least
they should be kept to a minimum. You will find the form
for html abstract submission <a href="#9">below</a>. 
Also, anyone who wants submit a ps file may do so, 
preferrable by email to <a href="mailto:cm98@boulder.colorado.edu">
cm98@boulder.colorado.edu </a>.
<p>
You are also encouraged to submit an extended abstract

and/or the <a href="#11">Hardcopy Preliminary Proceedings</a> 
as described below.

<p>
<a name="9"><h2>WHERE TO SUBMIT</h2>
Potential contributors should submit an abstract 
by email to 
<a href="mailto:cm98@boulder.colorado.edu"> 
cm98@boulder.colorado.edu
</a>.
<p>
<a href="abstract"> Click here </a> to display the html form
for submitting your abstract. Then please
download or copy it, fill in the information, and submit it to us by
<a link href="mailto:cm98@boulder.colorado.edu">e-mail</a>.
<p>
You are also welcome to send us a ps file, but

<a name="10"><h2>VIRTUAL PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h4>For access to the MGNet Virtual Proceedings,
<a href="http://www.ccs.uky.edu/mgnet/mgnet-ccmm98.html">
click here</a>.
</h4>
Also available are the
<a href="http://www.ccs.uky.edu/mgnet/mgnet-ccmm93.html">1993</a>
and
<a href="http://www.ccs.uky.edu/mgnet/mgnet-ccmm95.html">1995</a>
virtual proceedings.
<br>

<p>
<h4>For submission of a paper to the MGNet Virtual Proceedings:</h4>
Instead of having to cram your paper into a few pages, you have as many pages
as you wish, preferably in an easy to read, large font (11 point is
easier to read than 10 point).
Please submit a PostScript file using the
<a href="http://www.ccs.uky.edu/mgnet/mgnet-how2sub.html">directions</a>
for a MGNet preprint submission.  Then send
<a link href="mailto:douglas@ccs.uky.edu">e-mail</a>
with a message that you submitted a pre-proceedings paper.
<p>
<em>The conference and it's participants are indebted to Craig Douglas
of the University of Kentucky for his service in support of the
Virtual Proceedings and MGNet.</em>

<p>
<a name="11"><h2>HARDCOPY PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
In order to guarantee a spot on the program, each speaker will be asked
to submit an abstract by Jan. 15, 1998.  Up until March 8, 1998, the
abstract may be replaced by an extended abstract of no more than 7
pages. All abstracts will be combined into a prelimary proceedings
and distributed to the conference participants. This must be in 
postscript or ASCII.

<p>
<a name="12"><h2>SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE</h2>
Speakers will be urged to submit a paper to a special issue of SIAM
Journal of Scientific Computing.  These papers will be subjected to a
rigorous refereeing process under the supervision of the program 
committee.  Papers will be due no later than May 15, 1998.  Authors are urged
to limit the length of papers to 20 pages. 
 
<p>
<a name="13"><h2>STUDENT PAPER Competition</h2>
Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to student
authors judged to have the best research papers.  Papers
containing original research due mainly to the student must be
received before Dec. 15, 1997.  They must be singly authored and
may be no more than 10 pages in length. Sending only
an abstract is unacceptable.  A panel of judges will determine
the best papers.  Authors of the best papers will
be given a travel stipend, free lodging, and registration, and
each will be expected to present their paper in one of the regular
conference sessions.  A number of other students who
participate in the competiton will be offered local expenses.
We hope to support 10 or more students,
but this is contingent on obtaining funding.
Student papers should be submitted as ps files by
<a link href="mailto:cm98@boulder.colorado.edu">e-mail</a>.
If this is not possible, a hard copy of the paper may
be submitted by regular post to:
