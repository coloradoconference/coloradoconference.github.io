Also, anyone who wants submit a ps file may do so, 
preferrable by email to <a href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">

<h4>For submission of a paper to the MGNet Virtual Proceedings:</h4>
Instead of having to cram your paper into a few pages, you have as many pages
as you wish, preferably in an easy to read, large font (11 point is
easier to read than 10 point).
Please submit a PostScript file using the

to submit an abstract by Feb.1, 2000.  Up until March 8, 2000, the

Journal of Scientific Computing.  These papers will be subjected to a
rigorous refereeing process under the supervision of the program

to limit the length of papers to 20 pages. 
 
<p>
<a name="13"><h2>STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION</h2>
Travel and lodging assistance will be awarded to student
authors judged to have the best research papers.  Papers
containing original research due mainly to the student must be
received before January 10, 2000.  They must be singly authored and
may be no more than 10 pages in length. Sending only
an abstract is unacceptable.  A panel of judges will determine
the best papers.  Authors of the best papers will
be given a travel stipend, free lodging, and registration, and
each will be expected to present their paper in one of the regular
conference sessions.  A number of other students who
participate in the competiton will be offered local expenses.
We hope to support 10 or more students,
but this is contingent on obtaining funding.
Student papers should be submitted as ps files by
<a link href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">e-mail</a>.
Please send it as a single standard uncompressed text file.
If it is not possible to send us
a ps file, a hard copy of the paper may
be submitted by regular post to:
