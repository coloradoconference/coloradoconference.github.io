ARMS  is   a  recursive  multilevel  preconditioner   which  has  some
attributes  of   ILU-type  preconditioners  and   some  attributes  of
multilevel precondontioners.  It is  algebraic and general  purpose in
the same way that ILUT (for example)  is.  The main idea of ARMS is to
recursively form  the Schur complement system associated  with a block
reordering of the original matrix in the form

<pre> 
                    | B   E  | | x |   | f |
                    |        | |   | = |   | 
                    | F   C  | | y |   | g | 
</pre> 

The reordering is such that 
the block $B$ is block diagonal.  The Schur complement <br>
<center> S = C - F B<sup>-1</sup> E </center> 
is  typically sparse and as a result the same reduction process can now
be applied recursively. 
The method is inherently parallel, though no real parallel 
implementations are yet available. 
<p>
We  will discuss  a  number  of recent  ideas  and new  implementation
strategies  to enhance  efficiency.  We  will  also show  some of  our
recent  work in  enhancing the  robustness of  the algorithm  for very
indefinite problems.
