Physical properties of matter  can be  determined by solving a 
coupled  system    involving Schr\"odinger's equation   coupled   with
Poisson's equation.  This  coupling  is nonlinear and rather  complex.
It  involves a charge density  $\rho$ which can   be computed from the
wavefunctions $\psi_i$,  for    all  occupied states.   However,   the
wavefunctions  $\psi_i$ are the   solution  of the  eigenvalue problem
resulting  from  Schr\"odinger's  equation  whose coefficients  depend
nonlinearly  on the  charge density. This   gives rise to a non-linear
eigenvalue problem which  is  solved by  a so-called Self   Consistent
Field (SCF)  iteration.  The challenge  comes from the large number of
eigenfunctions to be  computed for realistic  systems which consist of
hundreds or thousands   of   atoms.  We   will  discuss   a   parallel
implementation  of a finite difference  approach  for this problem and
report on some results.

We will also explore the fundamental underlying linear algebra which 
can be viewed as a problem of determining the diagonal of a projector 
associated with an invariant subspace. Methods that avoid completely
the computation of eigenvectors will be briefly outlined.
