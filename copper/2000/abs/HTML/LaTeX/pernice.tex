The application of an inexact Newton method to two- and
three-dimensional flows is described.  Robustness and efficiency of
the method is largely determined by the preconditioner.  A linear
multigrid preconditioner that employs classical pressure-correction
methods as smoothers is described.  The flexibility of the approach is
demonstrated through application to both steady and unsteady problems;
use of a low-order discretization in the preconditioner; use of
mesh sequencing to address the problem of obtaining a good starting
approximation for the inexact Newton method; and implementation and
performance on parallel computers.
