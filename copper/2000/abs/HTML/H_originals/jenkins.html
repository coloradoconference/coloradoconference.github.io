<p>
Multilevel Schwarz methods are effective preconditioners for elliptic
problems.  However, developing the restriction and interpolation operators
between levels is nontrivial, especially on an unstructured mesh.  We have used
aggregation ideas from the algebraic multigrid literature to develop our coarse
mesh, and we have applied these ideas to problems discretized on 3-d,
unstructured meshes.  In this talk I will present theoretical results for the
bound on the condition number for the preconditioned system using a two-level
additive Schwarz preconditioner with aggregation elements for the second level,
and give numerical results for our work.
