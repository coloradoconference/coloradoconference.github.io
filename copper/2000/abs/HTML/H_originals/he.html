<p>
A novel iterative method for
the numerical simulation of a steady Bingham fluid flow in a cylindrical 
pipe is introduced. The method is of the primal-dual type and can be
interpreted
 as an
implicit scheme a la backward Euler, applied to a well chosen time 
dependent variant of the problem under consideration. A key ingredient of 
the algorithm is a kind of dynamical Tychonoff regularization of the fixed 
point relation verified by the dual solution.
After proving the convergence of the method we apply it to the solution of 
a test problem and verify its anticipated good convergence properties.
