<p>
Traditional VLSI circuit simulation is based on the numerical 
solution of large-scale stiff nonlinear systems of 
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs).  Numerical techniques 
for such DAEs require the repeated solution of large sparse 
systems of linear equations, and iterative methods, such as 
Krylov-subspace algorithms, seem to be predestined to the 
solution of these linear systems.  However, for various reasons, 
standard SPICE-like circuit simulators employ direct methods, 
rather than iterative methods.  Nevertheless, the continuing 
evolution of VLSI circuits has now come to a point where 
Krylov-subspace methods are finally becoming mainstream tools
in circuit simulation.  More precisely, today, Krylov-subspace 
iterations are employed to generate reduced-order models of large 
linear subsystems of DAEs that describe large linear subcircuits of
the VLSI circuit to be simulated.<p>

In this talk, we explain why and how Krylov-subspace methods 
are used for reduced-order modeling in VLSI circuit simulation.
We discuss various desirable and in part conflicting properties
of the reduced-order models, such as high approximation
accuracy, stability, and passivity, and show how to achieve 
these properties by means of Krylov-subspace iterations.
Numerical results for a variety of circuit examples are
presented.
