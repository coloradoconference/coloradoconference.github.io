<br>Abstract

<p>
Newton-Krylov-Schwarz methods solve nonlinear equations by using
Newton's method with a Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioned
Krylov method to approximate the Newton step. In this talk we will discuss
the design and implementation of Newton-Krylov-Schwarz solvers in the
context of the implicit temporal integration on an unstructured
three-dimensional spatial mesh of Richards' equation for flow in the
unsaturated zone. The issues include nonsmooth nonlinearities, construction
and efficient implementation of the coarse-mesh problem, and temporal
integration. The second part of the talk, given by E. W. Jenkins,
will discuss the convergence theory for the method.
