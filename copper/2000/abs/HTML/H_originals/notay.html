<p>
We analyze the conjugate gradient  method with 
preconditioning
slightly variable from one iteration to the next.
To maintain the optimal convergence properties, we
consider a variant that performs an explicit
orthogonalization of the search directions vectors.
For this method,
which we refer to as  "flexible" conjugate gradient, 
we develop a
theoretical analysis that shows that the convergence 
rate is essentially independent of the variations in 
the preconditioner as long as a proper
measure of these variations remains reasonably small,
but not necessarily very small.

Further, when the condition number is
relatively small, heuristic arguments indicate that this
also holds for some truncated versions of the algorithm 
or even for the standard conjugate gradient method. 
Some typical numerical experiments illustrate these
conclusions while showing that the flexible 
variant effectively outperforms the
standard conjugate gradient algorithm in several 
circumstances.
