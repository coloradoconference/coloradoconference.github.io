Time series data acquired at the pixel level from positron emission
tomography images can be utilized to provide visual images of parameters
defining the physiological and biochemical function of differing structures/tissues
within the brain. In studies of Alzheimer's disease it is of interest to
quantify the data such that statistical studies identifying significant
change can be performed.It is thus important that quantification can be
made both reliable and computationally efficient. The standard approach
for the solution of this problem assumes a single input/single output model,
in which parameter estimates are made independently for each pixel. Even
at this level, there are still several questions concerning accuracy of
the estimation that need to be addressed, and in particular how to address
the contamination of the results due to the various measurement errors.
The first approach reported in the medical literature uses nonlinear least
squares data fitting for the parameters defining the model. This method
does not account at all for the error and has been found to be inefficient
computationally. More recent works discuss the linear least squares problem
which results from the Laplace transform of the underlying differential
equation. Although more efficient, this approach also does not account
for the measurement error. To overcome this problem a generalized least
squares method can be used. The method is further refined by the incorporation
of a penalty term which enforces the parameters to physiologically realistic
values. This latter approach, while requiring the determination of an appropriate
penalty parameter, can be incorporated in both the linear and nonlinear
models. The need to estimate the penalty can be avoided by the utilization
of a total least squares formualation. In this paper we evaluate the use
of the total least squares method in this context as compared to generalized
least squares with penalty, and investigate the formulation of the problem
as single-input multiple output. The latter model is designed to take advantage
of the locality of the data in the plane, hence treating the image as a
whole, rather than on the pixel by pixel level. A multilevel iterative
algorithm for the solution of this problem is proposed. Its effectiveness
for the appropriate account of measurement error and its computational
efficiency will also be discussed.
