<p>
SMP or multithreaded Parallelism is becoming increasingly important
particularly with the emergence of OpenMP as a portable API across
a variety of platforms.  SMP parallelism allows the use of serial
interfaces to parallel modules, thus hiding parallelism details
from users and allowing the immediate and effective porting of
codes from serial to parallel platforms.
<p>
We have followed this philosophy in developing algorithms for the
iterative solution of sparse systems of equations on shared memory
platforms. The aim of this paper is to introduce our work, to report
on the performance and scalability that we have obtained on a range
of platforms, to discuss related problems, such as the development
and use of preconditioners, and to describe our current and future
lines of enquiry.
