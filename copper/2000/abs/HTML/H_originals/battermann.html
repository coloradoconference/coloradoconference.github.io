<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
An optimal control problem governed by 
partial differential equations is 
formulated for a practical application. 
The partial differential equations model 
groundwater flow and heat transfer in an aquifer. 
The black box setting and a large error margin in the available 
data lead to inaccurate function evaluations, 
these causing failure of 
standard optimization routines. 
Numerical results will be presented for the 
Implicit Filtering and Nelder--Mead algorithms.
