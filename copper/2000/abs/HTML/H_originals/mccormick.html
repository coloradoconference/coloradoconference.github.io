<p>
Least-squares methods have become increasingly popular for solving a wide
variety of partial differential equations (PDEs). First-order system least
squares (FOSLS) is a special type of least-squares method that attempts to
reformulate the PDE so that it is self-adjoint with an associated energy
functional that is product H<SUP>1</SUP> equivalent. Some of the compelling
features of the FOSLS methodology include:<p>

   * self-adjoint equations, stemming from the minimization principle;<br>
   * good operator 'conditioning', stemming from the use of first-order
     formulations of the PDE or inverse norms in the minimization
     principle;<br>
   * finite element and multigrid performance that is optimal and uniform
     in certain parameters (e.g., Reynolds number, Poisson ratio, and wave
     number), stemming from uniform product norm equivalence results.<br><p>

Unfortunately, one of its limitations is that these benefits come only when
the original problem exhibits sufficient smoothness (it typically requires
H<SUP>2</SUP> regularity). An alternative to the usual L<SUP>2</SUP> form
of FOSLS is to use inverse norms, but this is generally very awkward and
it comes with substantially reduced efficiency.<p>

This talk will describe an alternative, called FOSLL*, that exhibits the
generality of the inverse-norm FOSLS, but retains the efficiency and
simplicity of the L<SUP>2</SUP>-norm FOSLS.
