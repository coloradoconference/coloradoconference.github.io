<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The quest for the ultimate incomplete factorisation is a struggle
between the demand for accuracy, and the demand for the well-definedness
of the factorisation. It is a well known phenomenon that ordinary
ILU can break down, even on SPD matrices. Various strategies to guarantee
a well-defined factorisation exist, but they often reduce the accuracy
of the factorisation. I will present a new factorisation that has
strong guarantees for its existence, and exhibits a reasonable
robustness in practical tests. The main idea behind this factorisation
is that fill-in in (i,j) is scaled, and moved to both the (i,j) and (j,j)
diagonal elements.
