<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (<b>TAO</b>)
focuses on the design 
and implementation of component-based optimization software for the
solution of large-scale optimization applications.  Our
approach is to
exploit numerical abstractions in optimization software
design, so that we can leverage external parallel computing
infrastructure (for example, communication libraries and visualization
packages) and linear algebra tools in the
development of optimization algorithms. The algorithms in the toolkit
place strong emphasis on the reuse of external tools where appropriate.

<p>
We discuss the design of <b>TAO</b> and our experiences
with solving large (more than 1 million variables) optimization problems
on parallel architectures. The talk emphasizes the impact of
iterative methods for the solution of the subproblems that
arise in optimization algorithms.
