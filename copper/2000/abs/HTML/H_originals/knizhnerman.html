<p>
The problem of rational approximation of Markov (impedance) functions on a
bounded interval of the real axis arises when constructing optimal
finite-difference grids for solving differential equations (see Vladimir
Druskin's abstract).
</p>

<p>
Pad&eacute;-Chebyshev approximation is a popular sort of rational
approximation due to its simplicity, though it is not optimal in general.
</p>

<p>
We show how to calculate a [(k-1)/k]

Pad&eacute;-Chebyshev</span> approximant of a Markov function by
means
of a<span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> Lanczos</span>
process.
We formulate an error estimate rendering concrete Gonchar-Rakhmanov-Suetin
asymptotical one. We also demonstrate that such an approximation on a
changed
interval can produce a better approximant for a given interval.
</p>

<p>
Implementation aspects are considered.
