<p>
Efficient methods for sensitivity analysis of differential-algebraic
equation (DAE) systems are required in model development, uncertainty
analysis and as an intermediate step in design optimization of
engineering processes.  We describe the sensitivity analysis problem
for DAEs by both the forward and the backward mode.  We introduce the
software DASPK3.0 for sensitivity analysis via the forward mode, and
outline a general adjoint method for DAEs.
