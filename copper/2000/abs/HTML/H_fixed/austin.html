<p>
An effective multilevel solver for (I - grad div) must account for the
presence of divergence-free error components.  As a result, the Raviart-Thomas
(RT) finite element spaces, which have locally computable divergence-free 
subspaces, are often used in the discretization of (I - grad div).  
The presence of an epsilon-sized Laplacian term, leading to
(I - $\epsilon$~Laplacian - grad div),
results in poor approximation properties for the
discontinuous RT finite element spaces.  We present a new, 
continuous, RT-like finite element space for the discretization of 
(I - $\epsilon$~Laplacian - grad div)
and a corresponding multilevel solver which 
includes divergence-free relaxation.
