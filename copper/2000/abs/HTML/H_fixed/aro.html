<p>
We report on the recent reformulation of the underlying
physics within the ALE3D implicit hydrodynamics module.
ALE3D is a three dimensional finite element simulation
code designed to run on massively parallel computers.
In addition to reformulated physics, ALE3D incorporates
an algebraic reduction algorithm that guarantees symmetric
positive definite matrices, even when sliding interfaces
are present.

We will present parallel results on full physics simulations
for a variety of preconditioning schemes.
