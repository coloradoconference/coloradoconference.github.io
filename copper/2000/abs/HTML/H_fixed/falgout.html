<p>
Much work has been done developing robust multigrid methods for
solving diffusion equations on structured grids, especially when
discontinuous coefficients and anisotropy are present (see e.g.,
[1-9]).  However, all of these methods have relatively high
computational costs and memory costs.  The goal of this work is to
develop an algorithm that is both robust <i>and</i> efficient.

<p>
We will present a method based on a modification of the multiple
semicoarsened grids (MSG) method in [4].  The robustness of MSG is
studied in [5], and a new, more efficient, variant is proposed in [6].
Our approach for improving efficiency is based on the relationship
between the MSG algorithm, the hierarchical-basis multigrid method
[10], and the sparse grids method [11,12].

<p>
The sparse grids method is actually a discretization method that
considerably reduces computational and storage costs with little loss
in discretization accuracy.  The method uses hierarchical-basis
functions defined on a subset of the MSG grids, and uses the so-called
combination technique to implicitly define the discretization on the
sparse grid.  It is important to note that although the sparse grids
method and the MSG method both provide solutions to the diffusion
problem of interest, they do not solve them on the same discrete grid.
We consider solving the diffusion equation with the MSG method, but
with only a subset of the MSG grids.  If we use the same grids as in
the sparse grids method, one can think of this approach as using the
sparse grids discretization to form the coarse grid problem in a
two-level multigrid method.  Since the sparse grids discretization is
nearly as accurate as the standard Cartesian discretization, we expect
this method to work well.
