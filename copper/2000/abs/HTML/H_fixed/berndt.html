We will introduce a first-order system least squares (FOSLS) formulation 
of the diffusion equation with discontinuous coefficient. We discretize this
equation using a standard finite element space augmented by singular basis 
functions. These singular basis functions enable us to resolve the flux 
without deterioration of discretization order in the neighborhood of 
singularities. Such singularities of the flux are typically induced by the 
geometry of the discontinuity of the porosity coefficient, or by reentrant 
corners. We introduce a multilevel solver for the discrete problem that 
utilizes singular basis functions on coarser levels, without compromising 
the efficiency of the solver.
