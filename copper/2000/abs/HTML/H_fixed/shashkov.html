<p>
We consider how mimetic discretizations can be used to construct
preconditioners for the solution of discrete diffusion equations.
For cell-centered discretization of temperature we show that different
discretization of heat flux can lead to different discretizations 
of diffusion equation. In particular, it gives a natural way of
``lumping'' the mass matrix. Then a ``simpler'' discretization can
be used as a preconditioner for a more accurate discretization.
