<p>
As the gap between CPU performance and memory access time continues to
grow, reducing memory access costs is becoming increasingly important
to solving very large sparse systems of linear equations efficiently.
This talk will identify and describe some existing memory-efficient
algorithms.  Because efficient data re-use is crucial to reducing
memory access costs, we are particularly interested in exploring
alternatives based on blocking the sparse matrix operations.  We are
focusing on variants of GMRES with the initial goal of contributing to
the understanding of the numerical properties of some of these
algorithms.  Our eventual goal is to develop a robust,
memory-efficient sparse linear solver suitable for inclusion in
Argonne National Laboratory's PETSc or a similar toolkit for
scientific computation.
