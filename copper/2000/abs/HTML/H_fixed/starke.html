<p>
We consider the least-squares mixed finite element formulation of
nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems using a combination of
standard conforming finite elements with Raviart-Thomas spaces for
the flux. For the solution of the
arising nonlinear algebraic least-squares problems suitable variants of the
Levenberg-Marquardt method are proposed. In particular, for elliptic
problems arising from an implicit time discretization
of a variably saturated subsurface flow model, we study an appropriate
norm for the definition of the trust-region. 
We study an inexact version of
this approach where the linear least-squares problems in each step are
approximately solved by an adaptive multilevel method.
For realistic variably saturated subsurface flow problems, the results
of computational experiments are presented.
