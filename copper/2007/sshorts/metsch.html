We present a new approach to the parallelization of AMG, i.e., to the
parallel coarse grid selection on AMG. Many different approaches to parallel AMG have been proposed over the
years. Most of them utilize the classical AMG coarsening scheme on
each processor subdomain and employ a special treatment of the
subdomain boundaries to cope with non-matching coarse grids. However,
the coarse grid structure on the boundaries does not respect the
classical coarsening principles.</p>
<p>In our parallel coarsening method, we do not employ an explicit boundary
treatment. However, we still use the classical coarsening scheme. 
We first construct multiple coarse grids on each processor domain
individually. We then construct a directed, weighted graph
whose vertices represent the coarse grids constructed on each
processor subdomain. We define edges between nodes on neighboring
subdomains and assign a weight to each edge describing the value of
the coarse grid constellation induced by these coarse grids. Finally,
using this graph, we select one coarse grid per processor subdomain
which automatically matches most of its neighbors. The results or our
numerical experiments clearly indicate that this approach results in
high quality coarse grids which are very close to those obtained in
sequential AMG. This leads to a significant better speed-up of our
algorithm compared with other parallel coarsening
techniques. Furthermore, the operator and grid complexities of our
parallel AMG are often smaller than those obtained by other parallel
AMG methods.</p>
