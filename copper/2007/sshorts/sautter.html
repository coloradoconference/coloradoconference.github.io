<p>
 The Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible isothermal flow
 of a Newtonian fluid are at the core of fluid dynamics.
 Since analytical solutions are only available in very
 special cases, numerical algorithms are essential
 for computing fluid flow simulations of complex, real-life
 applications with sufficient accuracy and efficiency.
 This is known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which belongs
 to the field of scientific computing.<br><br>

 There is currently no software package available that can
 handle any kind of fluid flow problem in arbitrary domains. The
 difficulty arises from the huge field of different flow phenomena
 and the numerical problems
 arising from simulations in complex domains, e.g. transient domains.
 <br><br>

 In this talk, numerical simulation techniques for
 Newtonian and some class of non-Newtonian incompressible fluid flow
 problems in stationary and transient domains, possibly coupled with other
 physical effects such as fluid-structure interaction, are presented.
 In particular, the efficiency of discrete projection
 methods for the time integration in conjunction with an algebraic
 multigrid solver is demonstrated.
 Accuracy, efficiency, easy extensibility, and applicability to real life
 problems are the main objectives of the presented methods.
