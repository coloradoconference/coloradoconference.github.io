In particular, usingsome weighted Sobolev space $K^m_a$ and the method of subspacecorrections with the elliptic projection decomposition estimate on$K^m_a$, we show that the multigrid V-cycle convergesuniformly for piecewise linear functions with standard smoothers(Richardson, weighted Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, etc.). In addition, we have a similar argument on high-order polynomials and numerical results will be shown.</body></html>
