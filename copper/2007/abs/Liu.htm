<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>Multilevel domain decomposition methods are well developed for elliptic 
problems. In this talk, we discuss some extensions of the methods for solving 
some harder problems, namely the coupled nonlinear systems of equations arising 
from the discretization of inverse elliptic equations. In particular, we focus 
on a fully coupled Newton-Krylov algorithm with two-level domain decomposition 
preconditioning. Four types of preconditioning methods will be discussed 
including the multiplicative Schwarz method, the additive Schwarz method, the 
F-cycle Schwarz method and the cascade version of the multiplicative method. We 
will present the parallel performance of the algorithms on computers with 
hundreds of processors for solving some difficult inverse problems with noise 
and jump coefficients. </P></BODY></HTML>
