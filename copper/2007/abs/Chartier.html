<p>
Effective multigrid performance results from smoothing and
coarse-grid correction working together as complementary processes.
Coarse-grid correction is designed to capture those components of
the error not effectively dampened by relaxation. Adaptive or
self-correcting multigrid methods exploit information produced by
cycling to uncover algebraically smooth error and adjust the
multigrid components as needed in order to improve the rate toward
convergence.  This talk reviews the adaptive multigrid via
subcycling on complementary grids method.  It also discusses the
effectiveness of this method as a preconditioner for conjugate
gradient - where conjugate gradient is and is not included in the
adaptive setup stage. Numerical results are included.
