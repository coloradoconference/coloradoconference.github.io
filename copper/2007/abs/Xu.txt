<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
In this talk, a number of  optimal convergence results will be  
reported for multigrid methods on locally adaptive grids obtained by  
bisection.  Both BPX preconditioner and V-cycle multigrid methods  
will be considered for H1, H(curl) and H(div) systems.  A novel  
decomposition of newest vertex bisection will be presented for  
bridging the results from quasi-uniform grids with locally refined  
grids.
