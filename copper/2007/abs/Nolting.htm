<P>Local refinement enables us to concentrate computational resources in areas 
that need special attention, for example, near steep gradients and 
singularities. In order to use local refinement efficiently, it is important to 
be able to quickly estimate local error. FOSLS is an ideal method to use for 
this because the FOSLS functional yields a sharp a posteriori error measure for 
each element. This talk will discuss a strategy for determining which elements 
to refine in order to optimize the accuracy per computational cost on each level 
of refinement. Set in the context of a full multigrid algorithm, our strategy 
for the steep gradient case leads to a refinement pattern with nearly equal 
error on each element. Further refinement is essentially uniform, which allows 
for an efficient parallel implementation. In the case where singularities exist, 
the refinement pattern is modified to account for error reduction differences 
for elements that are close to the singularities. Numerical experiments will be 
presented. </P></BODY></HTML>
