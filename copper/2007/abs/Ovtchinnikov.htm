<P>In this talk we discuss the performance of some two-level Schwarz 
preconditioning techniques applied to Newton-Krylov algorithms for the numerical 
solution of magnetohydrodynamics. Good parallel performance makes the one-level 
additive Schwarz preconditioner a sound choice for the large-scale simulation 
when the number of processors is not too large. However, the growth in the 
number of linear iterations substantially degrades the parallel efficiency of 
the one-level preconditioner as the number of subdomains increases beyond one 
thousand. Two-level preconditioners may provide more efficient means of the 
inter-subdomain communication than the overlap between subdomains by 
incorporating a coarse space. In this work we compare the computing time and 
linear iteration counts of one- and two-level preconditioning methods including 
the additive, the multiplicative, and the F-cycle versions of the method. We 
report experimental results obtained on an IBM BG/L with thousands of 
processors. </P></BODY></HTML>
