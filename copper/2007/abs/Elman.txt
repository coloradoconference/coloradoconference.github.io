<br>Abstract 
We study multigrid for the stochastic steady-state diffusion problem 
where the diffusion coefficient has a finite Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion. 
The problem is discretized in space using linear finite elements 
and in the ``stochastic component'' with a polynomial chaos method. 
The resulting discrete system is solved using multigrid where 
the spatial discretization varies from grid to grid while the 
stochastic discretization is held constant. 
We establish a ``textbook'' multigrid convergence rate independent 
of spatial mesh size and polynomial degree of the stochastic component 
of the problem, and we demonstrate performance with experiments.
