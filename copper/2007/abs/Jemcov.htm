<P>The Classical approach to constructing an Algebraic Multigrid Solver (AMG) 
for the solution of linear system of equations is to select a smoother and 
devise an agglomeration strategy to follow the smooth error component on 
successive levels. Performance of an AMG solver is dependent on the ability of 
agglomeration to closely represent the distribution of the smooth error 
components on a given level and, to a lesser degree, on a choice of smoother. 
Successful agglomeration strategies result in better performance of AMG 
solvers.<BR><BR>Agglomeration strategies are hardly universal and depend on the 
physical properties of the problem and numerical properties of the 
discretization technique used to create the system of linear equations under 
consideration: agglomeration that leads to success in one case may lead to 
failure in another. Furthermore, complex agglomeration may incur a computational 
penalty associated with the construction of restriction and prolongation 
operators, with potentially unacceptable computational time overhead. This is 
particularly important in time-dependent solution of partial differential 
equations, where a linear system is solved many times per time step. Additional 
problems are associated with the need to tune the agglomeration, when the 
primary goal is the analysis of the underlying problem and not a search for new 
agglomeration strategies. It is therefore desirable to to devise a 
computationally efficient agglomeration robust enough to handle wide range of 
problems.<BR><BR>One simple and popular matrix coarsening algorithm is the 
Agglomerative Method. the basic assumption in agglomerative multigrid is the 
homogeneity of the smooth error distribution within the agglomeration stencil. 
The result of the application of this agglomeration strategy is that every fine 
level equation will have a representation on a coarse level and moreover, coarse 
level corrections will be constant within a given interpolation stencil. 
Homogeneous smooth error distribution assumption is correct only in a very 
special cases of strongly elliptic problems with constant coefficients 
discretized on uniform grids. In practical application this assumption is rarely 
met and an Algebraic Multigrid solver that uses this agglomeration strategy can 
easily fail to converge. The attraction of this agglomeration strategy is in its 
simplicity and computational efficiency since prolongation and restriction 
operators are known a priori thus reducing the overall number of operations per 
multigrid cycle resulting in a very fast algorithm. This agglomeration strategy 
is effective if the discretization method produces linear system of equation 
whose matrix has M-matrix properties. In that case, simple scaling of 
corrections based on variational considerations can substantially improve 
performance of the multigrid solver. However, if the underlying matrix violates 
M-matrix properties, the assumption of homogeneous smooth error distribution 
within a stencil is not applicable and agglomeration strategy that closely 
follows smooth error distribution is more effective.This, of course, comes at 
increased computational time and larger memory usage.<BR><BR>One solution to 
this problem is to use Agglomerative Algebraic Multigrid Solver as a 
preconditioner to Krylov subspace methods. This approach allows for flexibility 
of the selection of the most appropriate Krylov subspace solver that fits the 
needs of the problem at hand and significant performance gain results from the 
proper choice of the solver and preconditioner. However, often the spectrum of 
the iteration matrix may be influenced by the quality of the computational grid 
and peculiarities of the physical models used in the discretization process thus 
making the process of selection of the appropriate Krylov subspace method 
harder. When this is the case, a careful choice of the type of the cycle, 
smoother and agglomeration stencil for the multigrid preconditioner together 
with appropriate Krylov subspace solver will strike the right balance between 
computational cost and efficiency. In principle, these choices are not known a 
priori and every problem requires some amount of tuning of the solver and 
preconditioner parameters.<BR><BR>Another solution to this problem is in the 
enhancement of the Agglomerative Algebraic Multigrid Solver by Recursive 
Projection Method (RPM). The idea of the RPM consists of the projection of the 
solution vector and fixed-point function onto stable and unstable spaces thus 
separating unstable eigenvalues of the iteration matrix from the stable ones. 
The principal question in this approach is the one of the construction of stable 
and unstable orthogonal projectors. Projectors are constructed from the 
recursive property of the the algebraic multigrid algorithm which states that 
the error propagation through iterations is according to powers of the iteration 
matrix. If the error is defined as the difference between two consecutive 
solves, then these differences form the Krylov basis of the problem. The 
dominant eigenspace is extracted from this basis by performing the 
QR-decomposition of the rectangular matrix whose columns are difference vectors. 
Diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix R in QR-decomposition are used 
to determine which columns of the matrix Q span the unstable space. This 
procedure is performed when the AMG starts experiencing stalling or divergence 
of L2 norm of the linear system residual. Once the unstable basis is determined, 
the unstable projector is constructed and stable projector is obtained from the 
fact that these projectors are orthogonal.With the knowledge of stable and 
unstable projectors, the fixed-point function of Agglomerative Algebraic 
Multigrid Solver together with the current solution is projected on stable and 
unstable spaces. The stable part of the algorithm proceeds to iterate according 
to AMG algorithm with stable part of the solution, whereas for the unstable part 
of the solution the special Newton algorithm is constructed. At the convergence, 
full solution is constructed from unstable and stable parts by the direct 
summation.<BR><BR>RPM solver is implemented as a wrapper around agglomerative 
AMG solver in such way that it becomes active only when divergence or stalled 
convergence is detected. In that case, dominant eigenspace is determined and 
stable and unstable projectors are constructed and solution is projected onto 
those spaces. The basis of unstable space is recursively enriched until all 
unstable modes are captured at which time rapid convergence is experienced. The 
advantage of this method is in its dynamic nature since it is activated only 
when needed. In contrast to preconditioned Krylov space solvers, RPM is 
universal in nature and very efficient from the computational point of 
view.<BR><BR></P></BODY></HTML>
