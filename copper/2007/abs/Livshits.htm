<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>The Schrodinger eigenvalue problem appears in a variety of applications, for 
instance, in the Kohn-Sham formulation for the claculation of electronic 
structures. Multiscale/multigrid methods, in particular algebraic multigrid 
methods, have shown to be an efficient strategy forboth finding solution and 
performing application tasks typical for the problem. In this talk we 
concentrate on different choices of proplongation and restriction operators used 
for bulding coarse scale equations, as a part of the Galerkin procedure. 
Numerical experiments and discussion of possible extensions of presented results 
conclude the talk. </P></BODY></HTML>
