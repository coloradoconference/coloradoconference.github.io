<p>
A multigrid algorithm for isotropic neutron transport is presented in x-y geometry, 
using discrete ordinates in angle and corner balance finite differencing in space.  
Like Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA), this algorithm employs transport sweeps, 
followed by a correction from a coarse angular subspace.  
While DSA uses a Galerkin P-1 closure to form the coarse-grid system, 
the method presented here uses a scaled least squares minimization principle.  
The goal of the minimization principle is to avoid the problems of 
“consistent differencing” associated with DSA.  
The algorithm is viewed as a “two-grid” scheme in angle, 
where sweeps are the relaxation, and the coarse-grid system is 
obtained from the scaled least squares minimization.  
The coarse-grid system is subsequently solved with standard spatial multigrid.  
Numerical results are presented.
