<p>
For problems featuring anisotropies, modifications of the multigrid 
coarsening process are usually required to achieve good convergence.
With algebraic multigrid methods, such modifications are automated 
and good convergence properties are observed in practice. 

<p>
These favorable convergence properties typically come at the cost 
of a less aggressive coarsening, so it is vital that the coarsening 
process guarantee that the coarse-level operators maintain good sparsity. 
In the context of smoothed aggregation methods, the tentative
multigrid transfer operators are subjected to a subsequent 
smoothing, which naturally increases the supports of the coarse-level
basis functions, further emphasizing the need to control the sparsity 
of the coarse-level operators. Several such approaches have been 
recently considered. This presentation aims to explain the treatment 
currently utilized by our smoothed aggregation multilevel iterative solver, 
parSAMIS.
