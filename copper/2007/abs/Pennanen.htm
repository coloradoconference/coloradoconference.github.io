<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>In this study, we describe an Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG) which is a 
modification of F. Kickinger's graph-based AMG [<A 
href="https://webmail.colorado.edu/view.php?thismailbox=INBOX&amp;index=49523&amp;id=2&amp;actionID=113&amp;mime=3dc740224d74fc0b41279d46c8356c41#Kickinger" 
target=_blank>1</A>]. In Kickinger's AMG, coarsening is based on the graph of 
the system matrix only, instead of strongly connected components in the matrix, 
as it is in the "classical" AMG by Ruge and Stüben [<A 
href="https://webmail.colorado.edu/view.php?thismailbox=INBOX&amp;index=49523&amp;id=2&amp;actionID=113&amp;mime=3dc740224d74fc0b41279d46c8356c41#Ruge">2</A>]. 
This leads to fast computation of both coarse grid matrices and interpolation 
operators between coarse and fine levels. By some minor changes in the selection 
of coarse grid variables and processing of Dirichlet boundary conditions, we 
have obtained more robustness to the method. Additionally, we have extended the 
method in a way presented e.g. in [<A 
href="https://webmail.colorado.edu/view.php?thismailbox=INBOX&amp;index=49523&amp;id=2&amp;actionID=113&amp;mime=3dc740224d74fc0b41279d46c8356c41#Wabro">3</A>] 
to be more suitable for vector-valued problems. <BR><BR>In numerical tests, we 
have used our method as well as a solver as a preconditioner for linear systems 
of equations arising from discretization of various mathematical models of 
physical phenomena, such as fluid flow, acoustics, linear elasticity, etc. Here 
we will show numerical results for two different application areas: <BR><BR>1) 
incompressible, viscous flow problems in 3-D, and, <BR><BR>2) scattering of 
sound waves in 2-D. <BR><BR>In the first case, AMG is used as a solver for the 
Oseen problem arising from Picard-type linearization of steady state 
Navier-Stokes. Linear Lagrangian finite elements are used as a discretization, 
stabilized by the well-known scheme by Franca, Frey and Hughes. Incomplete LU 
factorization with relaxation in smoothing steps is employed as a smoother. In 
the second case, our method is used to approximate inverse of the 
shifted-Laplacian operator which is used as a preconditioner for the Helmholz 
equation. In [<A 
href="https://webmail.colorado.edu/view.php?thismailbox=INBOX&amp;index=49523&amp;id=2&amp;actionID=113&amp;mime=3dc740224d74fc0b41279d46c8356c41#Erlangga">4</A>], 
this was done by using a geometric multigrid. The equations are discretized by 
linear, quadratic, and cubic Lagrangian finite elements. For both cases we have 
obtained good convergence results, but the stabilization scheme in the first 
case restricts the number of coarse levels. <BR><BR>References <BR><BR>[<A
