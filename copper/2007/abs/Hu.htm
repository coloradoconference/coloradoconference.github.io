<p>

Parallel multigrid for large-scale simulations presents unique
challenges, due to the need to simultaneously address parallel and algorithmic
performance.  System resources are often constrained because of demands from
other parts of the application, coarse-level problems can have
large communication to computation ratios, and load-balancing of the linear
systems may be optimized for something other than the linear solver.
We consider approaches, such as using more expensive smoothing with more aggressive
coarsening, and present numerical results on thousands of processors.
