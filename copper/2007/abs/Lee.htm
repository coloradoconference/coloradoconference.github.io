<P>The Immersed boundary method is a mathematical and computational framework 
for problems involving the interaction of fluid and structure. We previously 
proposed an implicit numerical scheme for the advection-electrodiffusion of 
solutes in the <EM>solute-fluid-structure</EM> interaction in the paper[1]. 
Stiff elasticity on the boundary makes the fluid velocity gradient large across 
the boundary. Chemical potential gradients and electrical potential gradient are 
also huge across the boundary. Near the immersed boundary, local mesh refinement 
is needed. In this paper, the Stokes equations are solved adaptively based on 
the uniform grid approach of the paper[2]. The projection operator is carefully 
devised by a cell-centered approximate projection method. The 
advection-electrodiffusion equations are solved by the combination of geometric 
and algebraic multigrid methods. SAMRAI and Hypre frameworks are the building 
blocks for the numerical implementation. The adaptive results give us the same 
accuracy with those on uniform grid with the finest resolution. The implicit 
scheme make the time stepping flexible within the constraint of CFL. <BR><BR>[1]
