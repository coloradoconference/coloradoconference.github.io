In the recent years, technology in the field of industrial production
had to cope with an increasing need for short production runs, a high
product diversification and complexity and thus, continuous
developments on metal forming have taken place. Along with aspects
from manufacturing the numerical simulation of forming processes has
received steady progress and current methods perform well in that
field of application [5].<br>

As one of the more recent approaches incremental forming processes try
to achieve those industrial demands due to their high flexibility.
They are specially designed as a low-cost alternative for difficult
product geometries, variable low-series productions or prototyping. In
the process, the product is formed in multiple sequentially similar
steps of a small and simple die. Plastic forming only occurs in a very
small zone of the work piece, while wide regions of it undergo only
elastic deformation [2]. Bulk forming as well as sheet metal forming
are possible processes for application of the method.<br>

The numerical properties of those simulations obstruct an efficient
simulation with current methods, though. Beside a high number of
unknowns and time steps, large deformations, unsteady boundary
conditions and the need for continual mesh adaption are aspects that
have to be taken into account. Moreover, nonlinear constitutive laws
and the indispensible presence of multibody contact between dies and
work pieces complicate the computations and lead to unacceptably high
computation times. The main problem encountered is the conditioning of
the system matrices upon which iterative solvers struggle with bad
convergence.  Algebraic multigrid methods have proven to be very
efficient on finite element discretizations and to overcome mesh
dependency but maintain the good complexity of multigrid methods [1][4].
It has been shown that those methods perform well on simulations of
incremental forming processes compared to other iterative solvers and
retain a high robustness and efficiency [3].<br>

This paper investigates the performance of an algebraic multigrid
(AMG) solver when different strategies of using certain process
characteristics of incremental forming are applied.  The main idea of
those strategies is to exploit the local restriction of the actual
forming on the model, which is the most striking difference to other
forming processes. The discussion includes the consideration of those
process properties within the AMG setup as well as in an feasible
schur complement decomposition. Numerical results are given.<br><br><br>
