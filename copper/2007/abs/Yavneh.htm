<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>In a companion talk by Roman Wienands, a new automatic coarsening method 
(ACA_1) is described, that yields robust convergence behavior, while allowing 
explicit control of the coarse-grid stencil. In this talk we apply this 
formalism to automatically construct the restriction, as well as the coarse-grid 
operator. We call this approach ACA_2. <BR><BR>Given prescribed stencils 
(sparsity patterns) for the restriction and the coarse-grid operator, of sizes 
$N_R$ and $N_L$, respectively, we choose $N_L+N_R-1$ local basis functions per 
coarse-grid variable, and construct a restriction and a coarse-grid operator 
that provide an exact approximation for all functions belonging to the subspace 
spanned by these basis functions. By pre-computing a unique and sparse set of 
so-called Canonical Basis Functions (CBFs), the computational effort required 
for setup is not excessive. The resulting solver is compared with classical 
Black-Box multigrid (BBox) of Dendy (1982), and with ACA_1 that uses BBox 
restriction and prolongation, for a suite of diffusion problems with 
discontinuous coefficients. <BR><BR>We also present an algebraic viewpoint of 
both ACA_1 and ACA_2. We show that (Petrov)-Galerkin coarsening is in fact a 
special case of ACA_1, and demonstrate how ACA_1 gains sparsity in return for 
redundancy. We further describe some preliminary theoretical results, including 
conditions under which ACA_2 yields an exact solution at the coarse points.
