<P>In this talk we introduce new finite element spaces that can be constructed 
for agglomerates of standard elements in 3--d. The agglomerates are assumed to 
have certain regular structure in the sense that they share faces with closed 
boundaries composed of 1-d edges. The spaces are subspaces of a originally given 
de Rham sequence of respective $H^1$-conforming, $H(curl)$--conforming, 
$H(div)$--conforming and piecewise constant spaces. The procedure can be 
recursively applied so that a sequence of nested de Rham complexes can be 
constructed. As an application, we use the sequence of nested counterparts of 
the respective piecewise linears, the lowest order Nedelec, and the lowest order 
Raviart--Thomas spaces, to construct V--cycle multigrid as preconditioners in 
the conjugate gradient method. The resulting element agglomeration AMG 
(algebraic multigrid) methods appear to perform very similarly to the geometric 
MG in the case of uniformly refined meshes.<BR><BR>This talk is based on a joint 
work with Joseph E. Pasciak, Texas A&amp;M University.<BR><BR>The work of this 
author was performed under the auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy by 
University of California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract
