<p>
Google's PageRank method for ranking web pages models how a
'random surfer' follows links between web pages in a random
fashion. The stationary probability vector of the resulting Markov
chain provides a ranking of all the pages in the network.
Calculating this stationary probability vector is a very large
problem: Google now indexes 25 billion internet web pages.
We present a multilevel adaptive aggregation method for the
linear algebra problem of calculating the stationary probability
vector of a Markov chain. The method described is a variant of
adaptive algebraic multigrid methods for sparse linear systems,
and is also related to existing aggregation methods for Markov
chains. We apply our multilevel method to a set of stochastic
matrices that provide models for web page ranking. These
numerical tests serve to illustrate for which types of stochastic
matrices our multilevel adaptive method may provide significant
speedup compared to standard iterative methods. The tests also
provide some more insight into why the PageRank model is a
successful model for determining a ranking of web pages.
