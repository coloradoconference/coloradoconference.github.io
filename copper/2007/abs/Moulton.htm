<P>Mimetic Finite Difference (MFD) discretizations of the diffusion equation, 
which are based on the first-order form, have gained significant popularity in 
recent years. The mimetic methodology has similarities with finite volume 
methods and mixed finite element methods (MFEM), but are the first to be 
extended to general polygonal and polyhedral elements while maintaining 
symmetry. In all cases, since these discretizations are based on the first-order 
form, they naturally lead to an indefinite linear system. Block elimination of 
the flux (i.e., vector unknowns), destroys the overall sparsity of the reduced 
system for the scalar variable. Hybridization, is one approach which improves 
the sparsity of this reduced system. However, for many existing codes, 
hybridization is not practical, hence we focus on treating the full indefinite 
system. </P>
<P>Motivated by the more localized sparsity structure of hybridized 
discretizations, we increase the degrees of freedom in a manner that leads to a 
more localized sparsity structure. Specifically, for the support operator MFD we 
consider augmentation of the flux (i.e., vector unknowns) such that an 
appropriate ordering of the unknowns leads to a new block diagonal system for 
this component. In contrast to the block diagonal structure of the hybrid system 
this system has blocks centered about vertices, and block elimination of the 
flux (i.e., formation of the Schur complement) leads to a symmetric positive 
definite scalar problem with a standard cell-based 9-point structure (in two 
dimensions). In previous work, we demonstrated that this reduced system is 
readily solved with existing robust multigrid methods, and that it is an 
effective preconditioner for conjugate gradient iterations on the reduced 
system. But we are really interested in efficiently solving the full indefinite 
system. Here we investigate two approaches to this problem. First we consider 
using the augmented flux system as a block preconditioner for GMRES iterations 
of the full system. Alternatively, we use inner and outer preconditioned 
conjugate gradient iterations to mitigate the lack of sparsity in the reduced 
system, the Schur complement, for the scalar variable. The inner iteration 
inverts the mass matrix for the vector flux and the outer iteration inverts the 
Schur complement for the scalar variable. Although, this nested approach is 
commonly thought to be too costly, here we find that it is faster, and scales 
slightly better than the preconditioned GMRES. </P></BODY></HTML>
