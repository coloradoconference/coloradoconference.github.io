<p>We investigate the behaviour of two efficiency based strategies for
adaptive grid refinement.
We assume that multigrid solvers are used such that the work for
solving the linear systems
is proportional to the number of unknowns. Refinement decisions are
based on maximizing
the efficiency, that is, for a given error bound, our objective is to
find a mesh sequence minimizing
the total work. To achieve this, we want to use a measure that will
tell us how to proceed from the
current refinement level to the next level. Two strategies are
presented: one is minimizing work
times error, and the other is minimizing the effective error
reduction. We consider an exact solution
that has a singularity. We first consider h-refinement. It is
observed that both strategies result in a
highly accurate mesh sequence efficiently. However, they fail for
highly singular solutions.
A modification is given for this situation by taking graded mesh
refinement for the element which
contains a singularity. It is shown that this modification improves
the performance of both
strategies significantly. The efficiency of these modified strategies
is also shown by comparing
with a threshold-based strategy. At last, we give similar strategies
for hp-refinement.
