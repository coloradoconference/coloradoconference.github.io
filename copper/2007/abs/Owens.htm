<p>
We introduce a weakly over-penalized nonsymmetric
interior penalty (WOPNIP) method for solving elliptic boundary value
problems. The WOPNIP method introduced has h-optimal error
estimates in both the energy norm and L2 norm. Also, although the
resulting global stiffness matrix has a condition number of order
h^(-4), there is a simple preconditioner that reduces the
condition number to h^(-2). This is a significant advantage when
designing a good smoothing procedure for multigrid algorithms. We
then prove that there is a bound (<1) for the contraction number
of the W-cycle algorithm, which is independent of the mesh level,
for an appropriately chosen number of smoothing steps.
