<P>The spatial discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations 
by finite elements, finite difference or finite volumes leads to systems of 
ordinary differential equations of very large dimension. Such systems can no 
longer be solved efficiently by classical ODE software. Their solution requires 
specialized solvers that take the structure of the problems into account. When 
using higher order implicit Runge-Kutta or Boundary Value Method 
time-discretization schemes, the size of the system to be solved in every time 
step amounts to a multiple of the number of spatial unknowns. We will show in 
this talk that these systems can be solved very efficiently, with a complexity 
that is linear in the number of unknowns when multigrid PDE-algorithms are used. 

<P>We will present in particular an algebraic multigrid algorithm fully coupled 
implicit discretizations of the time-dependent diffusion and curlcurl equations. 
The algorithm uses a blocksmoother, updating all stage values related to a grid 
point simultaneously. The multigrid hierarchy can be derived from the hierarchy 
built by any suitable AMG algorithm for the stationary version of the problem 
considered. By a theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we show that 
the convergence of the algorithm is similar to the convergence of the stationary 
AMG algorithm on which it is based. </P></BODY></HTML>
