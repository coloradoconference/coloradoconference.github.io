<p>
The two most common methods for constructing coarse-grid operators
for multigrid solvers are so-called Discretization Coarse grid Approximation
(DCA) and (Petrov-) Galerkin Coarse grid Approximation (GCA). DCA
re-discretizes the differential equation on the coarse grid. It is
very cheap, but generally not robust, and it is also specific to
differential equations. GCA is algebraic and often robust
(depending on the prolongation and restriction), but it incurs a
computational overhead. Much of this overhead is due to the
limited control over the coarse-grid stencil (sparsity pattern.)
<br><br>

The talk will present a new automatic coarsening method (ACA),
that yields robust convergence behavior - thus far demonstrated
only for structured grids - while allowing explicit control of the
coarse-grid stencil. For a given restriction operator and a prescribed
coarse-grid stencil pattern of size $N_L$, we choose $N_L$ local basis
functions per coarse-grid variable and construct a coarse-grid
operator that provides an exact approximation for all functions
belonging to the subspace spanned by these basis functions. By
pre-computing a unique and sparse set of so-called Canonical Basis
Functions (CBFs), the computational effort required for setup is
moderate. Using classical 
Black-Box Multigrid (BBox) restriction
and prolongation (Dendy, 1982), we obtain a solver that yields a
convergence behavior comparable to that of classical BBox for a
suite of diffusion problems with discontinuous coefficients, even
when using a 5-point star coarse-grid stencil.
<br><br>

The new formalism can also be used for automatically constructing
the restriction operator. This method, along with an algebraic
viewpoint of ACA, is described in a companion talk by Irad Yavneh.
