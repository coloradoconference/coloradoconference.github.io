<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>With the rising popularity of compatible discretizations (edge elements) for 
the eddy current Maxwell's equations, there is a corresponding need for fast 
solvers. We propose an algebraic reformulation of the discrete system along with 
a new AMG technique for this reformulated problem. This transforms the curl-curl 
system into a block 2x2 system where the diagonal blocks are an edge Hodge 
Laplacian and a nodal scalar Laplacian, respectively. 
<P>In this talk, we describe some basic properties of the de Rham complex and 
the Hodge Laplacian. Using these properties, we define a transformation that can 
be applied to the linear system associated with an edge element discretization 
of the eddy current equations. The key point is that the resulting linear system 
is much more ameneable to algebraic mutlgrid (AMG) and yields an identical 
discrete solution to the original eddy current system. In particular, an AMG 
method must now be applied to two Laplace-type systems (one a vector Hodge 
Laplacian and the other a scalar nodal Laplacian). A second talk will discuss 
the AMG method and illustrate the computational efficiency of the reformulation.
