<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>Algebraic multigrid methods are efficient solvers for linear systems 
involving d-level circulant matrices. As long as the generating function is a 
d-variate trigonometric polynomial of fixed degree, they are optimal, i.e. O(N), 
and better suited than FFT-methods, which scale like O(N log N) and which are 
the common choice for such systems. 
<P>Traditionally, algebraic multigrid uses the Galerkin operator on the coarse 
grid. The use of the Galerkin operator is well-analyzed and works very good, but 
it has the disadvantage of growing stencils. To circumvent this problem, there 
exist approaches, which do not use the Galerkin operator on the coarse grid, but 
a collapsed stencil instead(e.g. Ashby's and Falgout's solver for structured 
grids [1]). 
<P>In this talk, stencil-collapsing is analyzed for the special case of d-level 
circulant matrices, as they arise in discretizing PDEs with constant 
coefficients and periodic boundary conditions. Structured grid AMG for d-level 
circulant matrices has been studied in detail in [2]. Instead of using the full 
Galerkin coarse grid operator, a spectrally equivalent operator using a 
collapsed stencil is used. Due to the collapsed stencil, the computational 
complexity of a cycle is reduced. Furthermore, if the stencil collapsing scheme 
is chosen properly, the use of two-color relaxation schemes is possible on the 
coarse grid, as well.
