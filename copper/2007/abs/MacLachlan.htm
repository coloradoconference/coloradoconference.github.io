<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>In the mathematical modelling of real-life applications, systems of equations 
with complex coefficients often arise. While most techniques of numerical linear 
algebra, e.g., Krylov-subspace methods, extend directly to the case of 
complex-valued matrices, many of the most effective preconditioning techniques 
and linear solvers are limited to the real-valued case. In this talk, we present 
the extension of the algebraic multigrid method to such complex-valued systems. 
The complex multigrid components are motivated by a combination of classical 
multigrid considerations and experiments with local Fourier analysis. We present 
results for the algorithm applied to linear systems arising from time-harmonic 
reduction of the Maxwell equations and for random matrices related to lattice 
gauge theory. </P></BODY></HTML>
