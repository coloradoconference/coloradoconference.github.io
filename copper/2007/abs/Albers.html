<p>
The setup phase in algebraic multigrid is responsible for building the
hierarchy of coarse grids, linear operators, and transfer operators
needed by the solve phase. Several coarse grid selection algorithms
have been developed, and of those, independent set-based methods are
the most numerous. Each of these algorithms searches the vertex
weights in a graph to select new C-points and often also traverses the
graph to identify vertices whose weights are to be updated. In this
talk, a new algorithm for conducting the search for coarse grid points
is introduced. Using a bucket data structure to organize the vertices,
the algorithm does not traverse the graph to identify new
C-points. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the
performance of the new approach.
