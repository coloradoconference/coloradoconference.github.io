<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>We consider two-level preconditioning schemes in which the coarse-level 
spaces are defined on the same geometrical mesh as the fine-level discontinuous 
space. Namely, we study coarse spaces based on continuous piecewise polynomials 
and based on piecewise constants. We show that these two techniques give rise to 
uniform preconditioners and present numerical evidence confirming the 
theoretical results. We also consider multilevel extensions of the two-level 
methods for mesh hierarchies obtained by either uniform mesh refinement of a 
coarse-grid mesh or element agglomeration of an ustructured fine-grid mesh. We 
present some theoretical results for these methods as well as numerical 
experiments based on them. <BR>This work was performed in collaboration with R. 
Lazarov, P. Vassilevski, and L. Zikatanov. </P></BODY></HTML>
