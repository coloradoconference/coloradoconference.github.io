<P>Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is one of the most efficient and scalable parallel 
algorithms for solving sparse unstructured linear systems. However, for large 
three-dimensional problems, the coarse grids that are normally used in AMG often 
lead to growing complexity in terms of memory use and execution time per AMG 
V-cycle. Sparser coarse grids, such as the grids obtained by the recently 
introduced Parallel Modified Independent Set (PMIS) coarsening algorithm [SIAM 
J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 27 (2006) 1019--1039], remedy this complexity growth, but 
lead to non-scalable AMG convergence factors when traditional interpolation 
methods are used that include only distance-one coarse grid points in the 
interpolation stencils. In this paper we study the scalability of AMG methods 
that use the sparser PMIS coarse grids, but combined with interpolation methods 
that include distance-two coarse grid points in the interpolation stencils. AMG 
performance and scalability is compared for previously described long-range 
interpolation methods and new variants of them, for a variety of relevant test 
problems on parallel computers. It is shown that the increased interpolation 
accuracy largely restores the scalability of AMG convergence factors for 
PMIS-coarsened grids, without significantly affecting memory and execution time 
complexity per AMG V-cycle. This leads to a class of parallel AMG methods that 
enjoy excellent scalability properties on very large parallel computers.
