<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>We develop a scalable parallel finite element solver for the elastic wave 
equation discretized using an implicit Newmark scheme in time on unstructured 
meshes. The resulting system of linear equations is solved with an additive 
Schwarz preconditioned Krylov subspace method. We present numerical and 
analytical evidence to explain the behavior of the algorithms and discuss 
applications to a fluid-structure interaction algorithm that implicitly couples 
the elasticity equation with the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate blood flow 
in compliant arteries. </P></BODY></HTML>
