<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>Black Box Multigrid (BoxMG) is a robust variational multigrid solver on 
logically structured grids. BoxMG standardly uses coarsening by a factor of two. 
It handles cell-centered discretizations on logically rectangular grids by 
treating the cell-centers as the unknowns to be coarsened. Such a strategy does 
not preserve the cell structure. That is, coarse-grid cells are not the union of 
fine grid cells. In some applications, such as local grid refinement, it is 
desirable that the cell structure be preserved. One such method was discussed at 
the last Copper Mountain Conference on Multigrid Methods, and it employed a 
strategy that preserves cell structure while coarsening by a factor of two. 
However, performance of this approach was unsatisfactory for certain 
checkerboard configurations of the diffusion coefficient. </P>
<P>The method discussed in this talk employs coarsening by a factor of three. It 
is a natural generalization of standard BoxMG, using operator-induced 
interpolation (which approximately preserves the continuity of the normal flux), 
restriction as the transpose of interpolation, and Galerkin coarsening. We 
present numerical results that demonstrate its robustness with respect to 
discontinuous diffusion coefficients. In addition, we explore its relationship 
with smoothed aggregation. </P></BODY></HTML>
