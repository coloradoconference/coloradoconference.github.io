<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>
<P>With the rising popularity of compatible discretizations (edge elements) for 
the eddy current Maxwell's equations, there is a corresponding need for fast 
solvers. We propose an algebraic reformulation of the discrete system along with 
a new AMG technique for this reformulated problem. This transforms the curl-curl 
system into a block 2x2 system where the diagonal blocks are an edge Hodge 
Laplacian and a nodal scalar Laplacian, respectively. In this talk, we propose a 
solver for the edge Hodge Laplacian in the reformulated system. We introduce a 
special aggregation operator which transforms the system to a vector nodal 
problem on the coarse grid. We discuss the need for matrix-free smoothing on the 
fine level to reduce the computational cost. Finally, we present computational 
results for problems in both two and three dimensions. These examples include 
multimaterial problems with large jumps in material conductivity.
