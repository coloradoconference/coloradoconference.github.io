<p>
Two-level overlapping Schwarz methods for elliptic equations combine
one level of local solves on overlapping domains with a global solve
of a coarse approximation of the original problem.

To obtain robust methods for equations with highly varying
coefficients, it is important to carefully choose the coarse space
used to construct this approximation.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by methods for the one-dimensional problem formulated using
energy minimization, Wan Chan and Smith [1] proposed a coarse space
based on a constrained energy minimization problem. 

This approach is supported by recent theory on the convergence of
Schwarz methods that takes into account coefficient variation [2].

The Lagrange multipliers for the constrained minimization problem are
found by solving a large linear system.

The coarse basis functions are then found by solving
local systems.

Xu and Zikatanov [3] showed that, for multigrid methods, the 
system for the Lagrange multipliers can be solved efficiently using an
appropriate preconditioner.

They hint at a preconditioner for the domain decomposition case, but
only present a Jacobi preconditioner, which is not robust for
two-level Schwarz methods applied to equations with highly varying
coefficients.

We propose a preconditioner for the domain decomposition case, discuss
how it can be implemented efficiently and demonstrate that it is
robust.

The resulting approach provides an algebraic way 
to construct a robust two-level
overlapping Schwarz method given only the system matrix and the
matrices representing the local spaces for the one-level method.
