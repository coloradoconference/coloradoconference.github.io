<CENTER><BR>Abstract </CENTER>Consider the linear system Ax=b, where A is a 
large, sparse and symmetric positive definite matrix. Solving this system for 
uknown vector x using a smoothed aggregation multigrid (SA) algorithm requires a 
characterization of the algebraically smooth error that is poorly attenuated by 
the algorithm’s relaxation process. For many relaxation processes of interest, 
algebraically smooth error corresponds to the near null-space of A. An 
eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of A, or minimal 
eigenvector, is an essential part of the near-nullspace of A. Therefore, having 
an approximate minimal eigenvector can be useful to characterize the 
algebraically smooth error when forming the SA method. This talk discusses the 
details of a generalized eigensolver based on smoothed aggregation (GES-SA) that 
is designed to produce an approximation to a minimal eigenvector of A. GES-SA 
might be very useful as a stand-alone eigensolver for applications that desire 
an approximate minimal eigenvector, but the intention here is to use GES-SA to 
produce an initial algebraically smooth eigenvector that can be used to 
initialize SA or an adaptive version of SA
