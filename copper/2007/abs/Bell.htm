<P>Discrete differential forms have numerous applications in the computational 
sciences. A prominant example is the use of mimetic discretizations, such as 
Whitney elements, in solving Maxwell's equations. In this case, preservation of 
the differential complex is crucial to numerical stability. Other noteworthy 
cases are discrete Hodge decompostions for divergence constraints and 
visualization. Lastly, "holes" in the coverage of sensor networks and other 
topological properties can be investigated with discrete k-form Laplacians. All 
of these applications require the solution of systems of the form (d_k,d_k), 
where d_k denotes the exterior derivative for k-forms. The most common cases, 
(d_0,d_0) and (d_1,d_1) in Euclidean space, correspond to (grad,grad) and 
(curl,curl) respectively. <BR><BR>In general, we seek efficient solutions of 
(d_k,d_k) problems on unstructured meshes. While efficient AMG methods have been 
developed for 0-forms (scalar) and more recently 1-form (vector) problems, the 
higher dimensional problems have received less attention. Such problems arise, 
for instance, in determining the presence of coverage gaps in two or three 
dimensional sensor networks. In both cases, the null-space of the k-th 
combinatorial Laplacian is used to identify potential holes. <BR><BR>Direct 
factorization methods, such as the Smith Normal Form, have been the primary tool 
in these topological problems. While suitable for small meshes, direct solvers 
become prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications. However, in many 
cases of interest only approximate solutions (e.g. to null vectors or hodge 
decompositions) are required, which combined with the distributed nature of such 
problems makes iterative methods more appealing. <BR><BR>In this talk we 
highlight recent progress in using AMG for higher-dimensional topological 
problems. We offer preliminary numerical evidence in support of this approach 
and discuss directions to further extend this methodology to larger sets of 
problems. </P></BODY></HTML>
