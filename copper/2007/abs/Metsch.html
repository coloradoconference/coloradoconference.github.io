<p>We present an improvement to the Coarse Grid
Classification (CGC) coarsening algorithm for parallel algebraic
multigrid (AMG).</p>
<p>The CGC coarsening scheme is based on the classical Ruge-St&uuml;ben
coarsening algorithm. On each processor subdomain, we individually construct
multiple candidate coarse grids. Then, we construct a directed,
weighted graph whose vertices represent the grids constructed by the
multiple coarsening runs. Edges are defined between vertices which
represent grids on neighboring processor domains. Each edge weight
measures the quality of the boundary constellation if the grids
represented by its incident vertices are chosen to be part of the composed grid. Finally, we transfer the
whole graph on one processor. There, we select one coarse grid for
each processor subdomain which automatically matches most of its
neighbors. 
</p>
<p>For a very large number of processors, the transfer of the whole graph
on a single processor is too expensive and can lead to a significant
load imbalance. In this talk, we present a modification of the CGC coarsening scheme
which overcomes this bottleneck. Using a parallel multilevel
(recursive) heavy edge matching technique, we obtain a smaller graph whose vertices represent
consistent candidate coarse grids across multiple processor
subdomains. From this graph, we can construct a coarse grid for the
whole discretization domain.</p>
