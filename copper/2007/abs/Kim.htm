<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Optimization or flow control problems have the usual three 
ingredients. First, one has an objective, a reason why one wants to control the 
flow. Mathematically such an objective functional is expressed as a cost, or 
performance functional. Next, one has controls or design parameters are expessed 
in terms of unknown data in the mathematical specification of the problem. 
Finally, one has contraints that determine what type of flow one is interested 
in and that place direct or indirect limited on candidate optimizers. 
Mathematically, the type of flow is in terms of a specific set of partial 
differential equations.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, In this talk, we concern the 
Stokes equations as the type of folw. In our case, the optimization problem we 
consider is to find an optimal state $(\mathbf{u}, p)$ and an optimal control 
$\mathbf{f}$ which minimize the $L^2$-norm distance between $\mathbf{u}$ and 
target velocity $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ subject to $(\mathbf{u},p,\mathbf{f})$ 
satisfying the Stokes system. Such constraint optimization problem can be 
converted to the unconstrained optimization problems by the Lagrange multiplier 
rule. It is a standard approach for solving finite-dimensional constrained 
optimization problem([3,4]). As a result, we have a coupled optimality system 
related to two Stokes type equations associate with state variables and adjoint 
variables. In this system, we use only state variables and adjoint variables but 
controls. This optimality system can be dealt with mixed finite element 
approaches. But, in our case, we use first-order system least-squares(FOSLS) 
technique by using the state flux $'\mathbf{U} = \nabla{\mathbf{u}}^t$ of the 
state velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and the adjoint flux $\mathbf{V} = 
\nabla{\mathbf{v}}^t$ of the adjoint velocity $\mathbf{v}$. We reformulate the 
coupled second-order optimality system as the coupled first-order optimality 
system. Then, we define the least-squares functionals based on the uncontrained 
optimal system in terms of appropriate weights and norms for the system. In 
particular, we impose a weight $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$ on adjoint system to get a 
good control result. We show that the least-squares functional is equivalent to 
$H^1$ product norms by proving the $H^2$-regularity of that optimality 
system[2]. This principles result in symmetric and positive definite algebraic 
system. We show that a least-squares principle based on $L^2$ norms applied to 
this system yields optimal discretization error estimates $H^1$ norm in each 
variable.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; For the numerical test, we use multigrid V-cycle 
method using Gauss-Seidel smoothing iteration on the unit square domain. And we 
also use the single approximating space of continuous piecewise linear 
polynomials for the approximations of all unknowns. Note that we use a simple 
target velocity that is a solution of the Stokes system. We examine the effects 
of changes in the parameters \sigma and $\nu$. Generally, effecting good control 
requires small values of penalty parameter $\sigma$. So, we observe the $L^2$ 
norm of between controlled flow and target flow. That is, we show the controlled 
flow behavior when $\sigma =1,0.1,0.01$, and $0.001$ for fixed kinematic 
viscosity $\nu=1$. Then, we see that the controlled flow matches the target flow 
very well for small values of penalty parameter $\sigma$. Now, we consider the 
controlled flow for different kinematic viscosity $\nu =1,0.1,0.01$ and $0.001$ 
when $\sigma=1$ is fixed. In this case, we see the norms of |u-hat{u}| and |f| 
are very similar to the ones of above varying $\sigma$ case. These computational 
results mean that if $\nu$ is small, then the flow is easily controlled by small 
control flow $\mathbf{f}$. Finally, we consider the dependence of mesh size 
$h=1/4,1/8,1/16,1/32$ for fixed $\nu=1$ and $\sigma=0.001$. We wee here that the 
norm of $\|\mathbf{u}-\hat{\mathbf{u}}\|$ and the value of objective functional 
are decreased.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a conclusion, we applied on optimal control 
problem with Stokes equations as contraints by using the earler FOSLS work[1] on 
Stokes system. Moreover, we imposed weights $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$ and $\nu^2$ for 
good control effecting good control of small penalty parameter and viscosity. In 
this sense, if we find the best weights then, a least-squares principles seems 
to be proper for optimal control problems. <BR><BR>References <BR>[1] Z. Cai, R.
