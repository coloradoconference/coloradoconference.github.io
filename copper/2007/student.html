<h2>STUDENT PAPERS</h2>
NOTE:This is pending support and may or may not be funded.Keep posted to this page for further information.
 
Any student or new Ph.D.  whose degree was awarded after
January 1, 2006 is eligible to submit a paper to our
Student Paper Competition.  Papers containing original
research due mainly to the student must be received before
January 8, 2007.  The student or new Ph.D. must be the
primary author and the paper may be no more than 10 pages
in length.

<p>
Sending only an abstract is unacceptable.

<p>
A panel of judges will determine the best papers.  Student
winners will be expected to present their paper in one of
the regular conference sessions.  We are seeking funds from
NSF for student travel support.  Should our proposal be
awarded, the student winners will receive a travel stipend
and free lodging and registration.  We will also provide
some support for up to five more students who submit
acceptable papers.

<p>
Student papers should be submitted
as PDF files by email to
<a href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">copper@colorado.edu</a>.
If this is not possible, a hard copy of the paper
may be submitted by regular post to:

Postdocs are not considered ``students'' for this
competition, but may be considered ``new Ph.D.s''
if the degreee was within the past year.  Postdocs
