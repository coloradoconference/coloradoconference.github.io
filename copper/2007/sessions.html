<h2>Multigrid Tutorial Day</h2>

A set of multigrid tutorials will be presented on
	<b>Sunday, March 18</b>.
Attendance is open to all, and there is no charge
or required registration.  All the tutorials will be
elementary in nature, and are designed to familiarize
the audience with the basics of the topic.

	<h3>A Multigrid Tutorial, Part I</h3>
	8:30 am - 11:30 pm
	<br>
	Presented by <i>Van Emden Henson</i>
	</center>

<p>This presentation is an updated reincarnation of the
tutorials Bill Briggs gave at Copper Mountain in 1987 and
1989. The 1987 tutorial led to the publication of the
popular book, <i>A Multigrid Tutorial</i> (SIAM books),
which has served as the introduction to multigrid for a
good many workers in the field. Assuming no familiarity
with multigrid, the tutorial introduces multigrid from
first principles, examining basic iterative methods,
coarse-grid correction, two-level approaches, and extending
to multigrid methods.

	<h3>A Multigrid Tutorial, Part II</h3>
	1:30 pm - 4:00 pm
	<br>
	Presented by <i>Van Emden Henson</i>
	</center>

<p>In this section we will take up some "complications"
that arise commonly in practice, and illustrate some of the
techniques used to deal with them.  These will be presented
in simple, model-problem form.&nbsp; Typical solution
methods will be outlined.&nbsp; Time constraints may
prohibit coverage of all topics.

	<h3>A Parallel Multigrid Tutorial</h3>
	4:00 pm - 5:00 pm
	<br>
	Presented by <i>Jim E. Jones</i> </i>
	</center>

<p>
This presentation focuses on the issues involved in
parallelizing a multigrid algorithm.  Assuming no
experience with parallel computing, but an understanding of
the principles of multigrid, the tutorial introduces some
of the standard and efficient techniques for developing a
parallel multigrid solver.

<br><table align=center><tr><td>
	<h4 align=center>Contents:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> Algorithmic and implementation scalability
	<li> Parallelization of multigrid by domain partitioning
	<li> Performance models and metrics for parallel multgrid solvers
	</ul>

<h2>Workshops and Circus Sessions</h2>

The program will include special time set aside for
Workshops and Circuses.  The Workshop Chair will encourage
and support informal workshops on special topics of
interest.  The Circus Chair, for each of the planned circus
sessions, will encourage participation and contributions
and will organize, set the schedule, and oversee its
progress.
