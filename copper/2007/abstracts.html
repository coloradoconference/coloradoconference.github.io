<a name="8"><h2>SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS</h2>  
<p>
In order to guarantee a spot in the program,
each speaker will be asked to submit an abstract by
	<b>January 29, 2007</b>.  
<p>
Abstracts
will only be accepted from the <em>intended speaker</em>,
and only in HTML form.
In the list of papers that we will eventually post, we will
include the name of the person who submitted
the abstract as the speaker along with a
link to the email address used in the submission.

<p>
<em> Abstracts are limited to <b>two pages</b>!
Please heed this limitation 
because longer abstracts will be truncated in the
<b>Handbook of Abstracts</b>
</em> (described below).

<p>
Expanded abstracts may be submitted in
PostScript or PDF form to the MGNet
Virtual Proceedings (described below).

<p>
<a name="9"><h2>HOW TO SUBMIT</h2>
<em>Please read this carefully:</em><br>
Potential contributors should submit an
abstract (not exceeding two pages)
to us by email, in HTML format;
	<blockquote><ol>
	<li>
	Download or copy the contents of the
	HTML framework in this file:
	<a href="abstract.txt">
	<tt><b>abstract.txt</b></tt></a>.
	<li>
	Edit the file by filling in the information.
	<li>
	Email the edited file, still in HTML form,
	to us at
	<a href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">
	<b>copper@colorado.edu</b></a>.
	</ol></blockquote>

<p><b>Submitting for "Theme Sessions"</b><p>
We encourage individuals to organize sessions on specific
themes.  If you are the organizer of a special session,
please let us know by email at
<a href="mailto:copper@colorado.edu">copper@colorado.edu</a>,
and include the title or theme of the special session and
the list of expected speakers.  If your submission is part
of a special session, please include the title/theme and
organizer of the session in the email message you send us
(not the abstract itself).

<p>
Do not send a PDF, PostScript, TeX, or LaTeX file. 
It will be returned if you do.
Your abstract submission must be in HTML format.
However, you are encouraged to provide a link
(using the correct HTML syntax)
to your PDF documents in the abstract,
if you have such a document online.

You may also want to submit a PDF (or
PostScript, or LaTeX) file of an extended abstract
or paper to the Virtual Proceedings,
described below.

<p>
Deadline for submission of abstracts is <b>January 29, 2007</b>.


<p><b>Student Papers</b><p>
Student papers are due
	<b>January 8, 2007</b>.
They should be submitted in PDF or PostScript
format (PDF is preferred),
but students whose papers are accepted will be asked
to submit abstracts in HTML format in due time.
At the time of submission,
please include in your email a statement
identifying the paper as a Student Paper.

 
<p>
<h2>HANDBOOK OF ABSTRACTS</h2>
We will provide a bound collection of abstracts to the participants
at the conference. It will include the two-page abstracts together
with a schedule and important notices. This should make it easier
to select which lectures and special sessions to attend. 
 
<p>
<h2>VIRTUAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
You may choose to submit your document
--- perhaps a longer version ---
to the <b>MGNet Virtual Proceedings</b>.

<p>
Submit the document as a PDF, LaTeX or PostScript file to
<a href="http://www.mgnet.org/mgnet-cm2005.html">MGNet</a>,
using the
<a href="http://www.mgnet.org/mgnet-how2sub.html">
MGNet preprint submission directions</a>.
Then send an email message to
<b><tt>douglas-craig@cs.yale.edu</tt></b>
with a message that you submitted a pre-proceedings paper.
