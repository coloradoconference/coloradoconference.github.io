A smoothed aggregation-based algebraic multigrid solver for anisotropic
diffusion problems is presented. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is a popular
and effective method for solving sparse linear systems that arise from
discretizing partial differential equations. However while AMG was
designed for elliptic problems, the case of non-grid-aligned anisotropic
diffusion is not adequately addressed by existing methods. Importantly,
it is shown that neither new coarsening nor new relaxation strategies are
necessary for scalable performance. Instead, a smoothed aggregation
approach is developed that uses a sophisticated energy-minimizing
prolongation smoother to produce a novel interpolation strategy. The goal
is to produce interpolation operators for the non-grid-aligned case that
are as effective as those for the grid-aligned case, which is known to
have scalable multigrid solvers. As a guide for determining
effectiveness, a measure for closeness to the ideal prolongator is used.
Key components are large interpolation stencils and coarse grid
injection. The paper concludes with encouraging numerical results that
also show a potential broad applicability to other problems, such as
elasticity.
