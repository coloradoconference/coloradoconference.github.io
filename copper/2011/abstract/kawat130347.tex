We examine an explicit sixth order compact finite difference scheme for
numerical solutions of the two dimensional convection diffusion equation
with variable coefficients similar to the one presented by Wang and Zhang
[18]. The sixth order scheme uses a multiscale multigrid method to
compute fourth order solutions on two scale grids, then applies the
Richardson extrapolation and an operator based interpolation scheme to
approximate the sixth order solution on the fine grid. Convergence
analysis is provided in this paper to prove that the sixth order method
will achieve the sixth order solutions for certain values of the Reynolds
number.
