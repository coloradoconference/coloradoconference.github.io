Two fourth order compact (FOC) schemes with transformation method and
non-transformation method to solve the two dimensional convection
diffusion equations with boundary layers are compared. The domain is
discretized on a stretched nonuniform grid. A grid transformation
technique maps the nonuniform grid to a uniform one, on which the
difference scheme is applied. A transformation-free scheme on nonuniform
grids does not involve any transformation. A multigrid method is used to
solve the resulting sparse linear systems from both methods. We compare
the accuracy of the computed solutions and the robustness and efficiency
of two schemes through comparison of maximum absolute errors, order of
accuracy and CPU timings.
