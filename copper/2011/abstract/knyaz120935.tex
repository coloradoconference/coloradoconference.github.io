For a given matrix $A$, its polar decomposition is $A=U|A|$, where
$|A|=\sqrt{A^*A}$ and $U$ is unitary. Let $A$ be real symmetric and
nonsingular, than the matrix absolute value $|A|$ is also nonsingular and
$U$ is the matrix sign of $A$, having only two distinct eigenvalues, plus
and minus one. The matrix $T=|A|^{-1}$ is the \emph{ideal} symmetric
positive definite preconditioner for the linear system $Ax=b$, making the
preconditioned MINRES to converge in at most two steps. We call $T$ the
\emph{absolute value preconditioner}, if it is spectrally equivalent to
$|A|^{-1}$.

If the matrix $A$ is (block) strictly diagonally dominant, the
preconditioner $T$ can be chosen as the inverse to the absolute value of
the (block) diagonal of $A$. Such a choice can, e.g., be efficient in
plain-wave electronic structure calculations.

For a model problem, where $A$ is a finite difference approximation of
the shifted negative Laplacian, we construct an efficient geometric
multigrid absolute value preconditioner, in which the smoothing is done
using the action of $A$ and $|A|^{-1}$ appears only on the coarsest grid.
Our numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of such a
preconditioning.
