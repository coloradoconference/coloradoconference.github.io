We describe some results for a non-standard, mixed-type
(elliptic-hyperbolic) partial differential equation and an efficient
multigrid algorithm for the numerical approximation of its solutions.
This type of equation arises in atomic physics and describes a new
object: the ``action-dependent wave function.''
