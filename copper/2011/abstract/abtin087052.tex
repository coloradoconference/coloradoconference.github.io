The fast multipole method (FMM) is an efficient algorithm for what is
known as ``N-body problems''. I will present a new scalable algorithm
and a new implementation of the kernel-independent fast multipole
method, in which both distributed memory parallelism (via MPI) and
shared memory/SIMD parallelism (via GPU acceleration) are employed. I
will conclude my talk by discussing the direct numerical simulation of
blood flow in the Stokes regime using the FMM. I will describe
simulations with 200 million red blood cells, an improvement of four
orders of magnitude over previous results.
