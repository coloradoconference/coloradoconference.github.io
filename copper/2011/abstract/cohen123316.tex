Modern GPUs are highly efficient massively parallel general purposes
processors. A single high-end GPU from NVIDIA can achieve several hundred
GFLOPS/s in double precision arithmetic. Because of their inherently
parallel and high-throughput nature, they are a natural fit for domain
decomposition and multilevel methods. I will give a brief technical
overview of NVIDIA's CUDA platform for GPU computing, and present initial
work to develop sparse linear solvers using CUDA.
