Coupled systems of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations
arise in many applications areas, from chemical engineering to
modelling of turbulent flows. The numerical solution of these
equations is complicated by the need to properly resolve boundary
layers, even in the simplest, linear cases. While there have been
significant advances in the development of robust discretizations,
much less attention has been given to the problem of solving the
associated linear systems.

In this talk, we present the development of geometric and algebraic
multigrid approaches for these problems that are robust with respect
to the perturbation parameter(s). Starting from uniformly convergent
finite-difference discretizations on meshes chosen to adequately and
efficiently resolve both the boundary layers and interior region, we
demonstrate robust multigrid performance with respect to both mesh
resolution and the singular perturbation parameters. While algebraic
multigrid approaches offer excellent scaling performance, we show that
geometric approaches can achieve similar scaling with much lower
computational overhead.
