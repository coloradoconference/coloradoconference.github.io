Robust semicoarsening multigrid algorithms typically construct an
interpolation operator using the matrix coefficients and an assumption
that the error to be interpolated is essentially constant in the
noncoarsened direction. This means that the interpolation operator is
constructed to exactly interpolate the vector of all ones. In this talk
we investigate the performance of the method when this target vector of
all ones is replaced by a vector obtained from relaxation on the
homogeneous problem as in bootstrap multigrid methods.
