With single-core performance no longer increasing, future performance
gains in computers will need to come from increased parallelism. The same
applies for applications, including algebraic multigrid solvers. As a
result, scalability on larger parallel machines is critical. In this
talk, we review the current state of parallel algebraic multigrid and
present performance models to highlight the challenges it is currently
facing, which center around an increasing communication burden and an
increasing number of idle processors on coarse grids. We then discuss how
these problems might be overcome by utilizing redundant data distribution
across otherwise inactive processors and through the use of additive
multigrid.
