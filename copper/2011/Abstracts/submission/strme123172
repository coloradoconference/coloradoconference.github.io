===ABSTRACT:
GPUs have established an alternative to get high performance in a
cheap and power-efficient way for a variety of scientific applications. We
present optimization techniques for geometric multigrid methods, evaluate
their benefit on recent GPGPUs, show how they relate to optimization
techniques on other platforms and compare their performance.
