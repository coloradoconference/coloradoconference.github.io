In this work we investigate the numerical solution for two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations on graded meshes. The approach is based on the Hodge
decomposition. The solution $\boldsymbol{u}$ of Maxwell's equations is
approximated by solving standard second order elliptic problems. The
quasi-optimal error estimates for both $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\nabla
\times \boldsymbol{u}$ in the $L_2$ norm are obtained on graded meshes.
We prove the uniform convergence of the $W$-cycle and full multigrid
algorithms for the resulting discrete problem. The performance of these
methods is illustrated by numerical results.
