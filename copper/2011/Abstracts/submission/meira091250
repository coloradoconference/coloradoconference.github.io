===ABSTRACT:
We describe some results for a non-standard, mixed-type (elliptic-hyperbolic) partial differential equation and an efficient multigrid algorithm for the numerical approximation of its solutions. This type of equation arises in atomic physics and describes a new object: the ``action-dependent wave function.''
