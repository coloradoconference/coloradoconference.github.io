The classical Petrov-Galerkin approach to Black Box multigrid for
nonsymmetric problems due to Dendy is combined with the recent
factor-three-coarsening Black Box algorithm due to Dendy and Moulton,
along with a powerful symmetric line Gauss-Seidel
smoother, resulting in an efficient and robust multigrid solver.
Focusing on the convection-diffusion operator, the algorithm is tested
and shown to achieve fast and reliable convergence with both first-order
and second-order accurate upstream discretizations of the convection
operator for a wide range of diffusion coefficients. The solver also
exhibits robust behavior with respect to discontinuous jumps in the
diffusion coefficient, and performs well for recirculating flows over a
wide range of diffusion coefficients. The efficiency of the solver is
supported by results of an analysis for the case of constant
coefficients.
