===ABSTRACT:
We develop multigrid algorithms for a quadratic $C^0$ interior penalty method for a biharmonic problem with essential and natural boundary conditions of the Cahn-Hilliard type. A multigrid solve for the Poisson problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is used as a preconditioner in the smoothing steps for the fourth order problem, which significantly improves the performance of the multigrid methods. Numerical results are presented.
