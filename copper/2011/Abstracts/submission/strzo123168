===ABSTRACT:
GPUs perform best on regular, independent work-loads while effective
preconditioners ask for complex, serially coupled computations. The
extreme cases of best hardware performance on slowly converging
numerical schemes or quickly converging schemes with slow serial
execution are poor choices. The talk discusses how to find the middle
ground by challenging the hardware with more complex data dependencies
and at the same time relaxing purely serial dependencies with parallel
variants. For structured matrices, we can now solve very ill-conditioned
linear equation systems that were intractable with
GPU hardware before.
