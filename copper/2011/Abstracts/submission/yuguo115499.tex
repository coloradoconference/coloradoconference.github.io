we consider the linear systems arising from the standard conforming
linear finite element discretization of the second order elliptic
equations with anisotropic diffusion. Our analysis applies to both cases:
(a) grids aligned with the anisotropy; and (b) grids non-aligned with the
anisotropy. Applying the standard two-level method to the finite element
equations, we show the error propagation operator corresponding to the
two-level iteration with block smoother, with suitably chosen blocks, is
a uniform contraction in the energy norm. We also provide numerical
experiments which validate and confirm the theoretical results.
