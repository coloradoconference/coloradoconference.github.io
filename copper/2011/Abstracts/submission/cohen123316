===ABSTRACT:
Modern GPUs are highly efficient massively parallel general purposes processors.  A single high-end GPU from NVIDIA can achieve several hundred GFLOPS/s in double precision arithmetic.  Because of their inherently parallel and high-throughput nature, they are a natural fit for domain
decomposition and multilevel methods.  I will give a brief technical overview of NVIDIA's CUDA platform for GPU computing, and present initial
work to develop sparse linear solvers using CUDA.
