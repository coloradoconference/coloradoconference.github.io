The Parallel Ocean Program (POP) is a general circulation model that
solves the three-dimensional primitive equations for ocean dynamics. In
this model, the barotropic momentum equation is formulated as an elliptic
partial differential equation, and a finite difference scheme based on a
staggered B-grid is used as the discretization scheme. The resulting
linear system is symmetric positive definite, and it seems very well
suited for a multigrid solver. However, due to the type of grid used for
the finite difference operators, off-the-shell multigrid solvers have not
been able to perform better than the standard preconditioned conjugate
gradient solver used in POP. In this presentation, we explore new
prolongation and coarsening operators for a geometric multigrid solver
tailored to this problem, which could lead to a significant improvement
in the performance of POP.
