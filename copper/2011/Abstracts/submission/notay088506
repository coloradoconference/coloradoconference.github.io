===ABSTRACT:
We consider aggregation-based algebraic multigrid
and focus on the class of
M-matrices with both nonnegative row and column sum. This includes matrices
arising from (stabilized) low order finite difference or finite element
discretizations of convection diffusion equations with divergence free
convective flow.

We first consider a simplified two-grid method with just one damped Jacobi
post-smoothing step. We show that the corresponding convergence factor 
can be bounded as a function of the convergence factor of the same scheme
applied to the symmetric part of the matrix.
Hence we can essentially reuse the methodology developed for the symmetric
case in %\cite{1}
[1]; that is, form aggregates
in such a way that a prescribed (user defined) bound holds on
the convergence factor.

Nonsymmetric problems raise however several issues that are not yet
 covered by a proper
theoretical analysis: the use of more efficient smoothing schemes such as Gauss-Seidel;
the influence of non-normality;
the recursive use of the method in a truly multilevel algorithm.
These aspects will be discussed in detail with the help of illustrative
numerical experiments.
