To design geometric multigrid methods, Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) is a
very useful tool. However, LFA for quadratic finite element
discretizations can not be performed in a standard way, since the
discrete operator is defined by different stencils depending on the
location of the points in the grid. In this work, a multicolor local
Fourier analysis is presented to analyze multigrid solvers for quadratic
finite element discretizations. With the help of this analysis, a
four-color smoother is designed, resulting very efficient for equilateral
triangular grids. By other hand, for anisotropic meshes, a zebra-line
smoother is proposed. Some results showing the good correspondence
between the two-grid convergence factors predicted by the analysis and
the experimentally computed asymptotic convergence factors are presented.
