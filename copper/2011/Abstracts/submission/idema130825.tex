In our research on iterative methods for the power flow problem in large
power systems, we have been using inexact Newton methods with
preconditioned GMRES for the linear solves. We observed that the Newton
convergence was often approximately linear in the total number of GMRES
iterations, independent of the number of GMRES iterations used in each
Newton iteration. This inspired us to further research the theoretical
convergence of the inexact Newton method.

We present a convergence theorem that relates the reduction in the Newton
error to the reduction in the residual error in the GMRES iterations.
Using this theorem we show that under certain circumstances Newton
convergence is indeed linear in the total number of GMRES iterations, and
independent of the number of GMRES iterations used in each Newton
iteration. Experiments illustrate the practical use of the convergence
theorem, and visualize how GMRES convergence influences the Newton
convergence.
