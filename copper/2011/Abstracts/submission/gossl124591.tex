In this talk we consider the inheritance of different types of spectral
equivalence in algebraic multilevel methods.

In detail we obtain a two level preconditioner
\begin{equation}
C_{2L}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}D^{-1}+ D^{-1}A_{12}{S}^{-1}A_{21}D^{-1} &
- D^{-1}A_{12}{S}^{-1}\\
-{S}^{-1}A_{21}D^{-1} & {S}^{-1}\end{array}\right]\label{twolevel}
\end{equation}
for a symmetric positive definite matrix
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}A_{11}&A_{12}\\A_{21}&A_{22}\end{array}\right].$$

Here $D$ and $S$ are approximations of $A_{11}$ and
$A_{22}-A_{21}D^{-1}A_{12}$ respectively.

\bigskip

In the talk we assume that $D$ and $S$ have some spectral property
related to $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}-A_{21}D^{-1}A_{12}$ respectively and show
that $C_{2L}$ defined by (\ref{twolevel}) has the same property related
to $A$.

This leads also to
new condition number bounds for two level methods applied as preconditioner.

\bigskip

These can be used to obtain new bounds for the multilevel preconditioner
and the so called \emph{AMLI} preconditioner

\bigskip

At the end of the talk we will see that for specific C.B.S. constants the
new bounds improve well-known bounds.
