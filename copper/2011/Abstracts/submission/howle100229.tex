Many important engineering and scientific systems require the solution of
extensions of standard incompressible flow models, whether by coupling
them to other processes or by incorporating additional nonlinear effects.
Finite element methods and other numerical techniques provide effective
discretizations of these systems, and the generation of the resulting
algebraic systems may be automated by high-level software tools such
those in the Sundance project, but the efficient solution of these
algebraic equations remains an important challenge.

Frequently, the nonlinear equations are linearized by a fixed point or
Newton technique, and then the linear systems are solved by a
preconditioned Krylov method such as GMRES. In this talk, we discuss
important extensions to the methodology and analysis of
preconditioning such systems. In particular, we extend existing
block-structured preconditioners (such as those of Elman, et al.) to
address these coupled systems, showing how an effective preconditioner
for Navier-Stokes may be combined with one for some other process such as
convection-diffusion of temperature to obtain a preconditioner for the
Newton linearization of a nonlinearly coupled system such as B\'enard
convection.
