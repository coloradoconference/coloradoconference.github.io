Poisson's equation on unbound domains was solved with a hierarchical grid
coarsening approach based on
Stephen F. McCormick's Fast Adaptive Composite grid method. We were
especially interested in the efficient interface treatment
with regular stencils this method enables. It was experimentally shown
that the convergence properties are very similar
to those of a fully refined grid scheme. The error behavior of a
second-order scheme was empirically analyzed for
an exemplary setup from molecular dynamics.
