===ABSTRACT:
Poisson's equation on unbound domains was solved with a hierarchical grid coarsening approach based on 
Stephen F. McCormick's Fast Adaptive Composite grid method. We were especially interested in the efficient interface treatment 
with regular stencils this method enables. It was experimentally shown that the convergence properties are very similar 
to those of a fully refined grid scheme. The error behavior of a second-order scheme was empirically analyzed for 
an exemplary setup from molecular dynamics.
