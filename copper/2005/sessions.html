<h2>
TUTORIAL DAY AT COPPER MOUNTAIN</h2>
A set of multigrid tutorials will be presented on Sunday, April 3rd.
Attendance is open to all, and there is no charge or required registration.
All the tutorials will be elementary in nature, and are designed to
familiarize the audience with the basics of the topic.

<h3>
A Multigrid Tutorial, Part I</h3></center>

<center>8:30 am - 11:30 pm
<br>Presented by <i>Van Emden Henson</i></center>

<p>This presentation is an updated reincarnation of the tutorials Bill Briggs
gave at Copper Mountain in 1987 and 1989. The 1987 tutorial led to the
publication of the popular book, <i>A Multigrid Tutorial</i> (SIAM books),
which has served as the introduction to multigrid for a good many workers
in the field. Assuming no familiarity with multigrid, the tutorial introduces
multigrid from first principles, examining basic iterative methods, coarse-grid
correction, two-level approaches, and extending to multigrid methods.

<h3>
A Multigrid Tutorial, Part II</h3></center>

<center>1:30 pm - 4:00 pm
<br>Presented by <i>Van Emden Henson</i></center>

<p>In this section we will take up some "complications" that arise commonly
in practice, and illustrate some of the techniques used to deal with them.
These will be presented in simple, model-problem form.&nbsp; Typical solution
methods will be outlined.&nbsp; Time constraints may prohibit coverage
of all topics.

A Parallel Multigrid Tutorial</h3></center>

<center>4:00 pm - 5:00 pm
<br>Presented by <i>Jim E. Jones</i> </i></center>

<p>
This presentation focuses on the issues involved in parallelizing a multigrid algorithm.  Assuming no experience with parallel computing, but an understanding of the principles of multigrid, the tutorial introduces some of the standard and efficient techniques for developing a parallel multigrid solver.
Contents

*Algorithmic and implementation scalability
*Parallelization of multigrid by domain partitioning
*Performance models and metrics for parallel multgrid solvers

<a name="6"><h2>FORMAT</h2>
Morning and afternoon sessions will consist of individual
talks of approximately 25 minutes each.   Workshop
and Circus sessions will be held in the evenings.
 
<a name="15"><h2>WORKSHOPS AND CIRCUS SESSIONS</h2>
The program will include special time set aside for
Workshops and Circuses.  The Workshop Chair will encourage and
support informal workshops on special topics of interest.  The
Circus Chair, for each of the planned circus sessions,
will encourage participation and contributions and will organize,
set the schedule, and oversee its progress.

<a name="30"><h2>SPECIAL SESSIONS</h2>
We encourage special sessions on focus topics of interest. Anyone 
wishing to organizing such a session should contact
<a link href="mailto:vhenson@llnl.gov"> Van Henson</a>.
Anyone interested in contributing to a special
session should contact the session chair.
