<br>Abstract

<p>
  During the last twenty years several algorithms have been suggested
  for solving time dependent problems parallel in time.  In such algorithms
  parts of the solution later in time are approximated simultaneously 
  to parts of the solution earlier in time. A very recent method was 
  presented in 2001 by Lions, Maday and Turinici, who called their 
  algorithm the <i>parareal</i> algorithm [1].
  The name parareal was chosen for the iterative algorithm to indicate that it is 
  well suited for parallel real time computations of evolution problems 
  whose solution can not be obtained in real time using one processor only. 
<p>
  The method is not meant as a method to be used on a one processor computer. 
  One iteration of the method costs already as much as the sequential 
  solution of the entire problem, when used on one processor only. 
  If however several processors are used, then the algorithm can lead to an 
  approximate solution in less time than the time needed to compute the 
  solution sequentially; hence parallel speedup is possible with the 
  parareal algorithm.
<p>
  The parareal algorithm has received a lot of attention over the past 
  few years and extensive experiments have been done for fluid and structure 
  problems [2,3,4]. In this talk, we will show that the parareal algorithm can be 
  reformulated as a two-level space-time multigrid method with an aggressive 
  semi-coarsening in the time-dimension. The method can also be seen as a 
  multiple shooting method with a coarse grid Jacobian approximation. 
  These equivalences have opened up new paths for the convergence analysis 
  of the algorithm, which is the topic of the second part of this talk.
<p>  
  First, we will show a sharp linear, and a new superlinear convergence 
  result for the parareal algorithm applied to ordinary differential equations.
  We then use Fourier analysis to derive convergence results for the
  parareal algorithm applied to partial differential equations.
  We show that the algorithm converges superlinearly on bounded time 
  intervals, both for parabolic and hyperbolic problems.  On long time
  intervals the algorithm converges linearly for parabolic PDEs.
  For hyperbolic problems however there is no such convergence estimate
  on long time intervals.
