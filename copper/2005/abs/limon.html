<p>
Continuing advances in the miniaturization of
integrated circuits have imposed new challenges to
designers of semiconductor devices, as traditional
circuit analysis tools are no longer applicable.  In
this study, we focus on the gate region of MOSFET
devices with an oxide thickness of order 4-6
nanometers.  For oxide layers of this width, quantum
effects start to become noticeable and the standard
equations of semiconductor physics require quantum
corrections.

The Density-Gradient equation [1], [2] is a means of
calculating approximate quantum corrections to
existing formulae without solving the full
Poisson-Schodinger system.  We use a one-dimensional
approximation to reduce the D-G equations to a set of
singularly perturbed ODE~Rs [3].  These equations have
interior layer solutions, which compromise the
numerical treatment of the problem if care is not
taken to resolve the large gradients in the solution
within the layer correctly.  

Several approaches have been proposed to resolve the
boundary layer region including nonlinear
discretization schemes [4], [5].  However, these
methods have difficulty resolving interior layers [6];
therefore, we propose a multilevel adaptive scheme to
solve the model equations.  The method is akin to
multigrid, but utilizes high-order inter-grid
operators, which preserve a nested space structure
throughout the various resolution levels, similar to
the methods described by Goedecker [7] and Warming &
Beam [8].  This multilevel method has several
advantages over the previous discretization schemes,
the most important being that it adapts dynamically to
interior layers without a priori knowledge of the
location or geometry of the layer.<p>
