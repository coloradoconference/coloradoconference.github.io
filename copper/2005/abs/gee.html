<p>
The increasing demands of large-scale complex solid mechanics 
simulations are placing greater emphasis on the
challenges associated with the efficient solution of the set 
of nonlinear equations. Here, the solution of large systems
of equations with material and geometric nonlinearities 
in a parallel framework is addressed.<br>
 
Instead of applying widely used Newton- or Newton-Krylov type 
methods that involve the derivation of a stiffness matrix and
a sequence of linear solves, the presented work details the 
implementation of a (nearly) matrix-free nonlinear algebraic
multigrid algorithm applied to solve this set of nonlinear equations.<br>

As a basic iterative method, a nonlinear conjugate gradient 
algorithm (nlnCG) using the Polak-Ribiere formula and
a secant method for the stepsize is applied. It has the advantage 
of being a completely matrix-free method
eliminating the need to form a stiffness matrix.<br>

Preconditioned nonlinear CG is then applied as a smoother/coarse solver 
in a classical full approximation scheme (FAS) nonlinear multigrid cycle.
Transfer operators are constructed by an aggregation approach operating 
on the graph of the fine level problem. The preconditioners to the
nlnCG on all levels are obtained by multicolor finite differencing and are 
chosen to be either simple Jacobi or a direct solve on the coarsest level.<br>
For Jacobi-preconditioned nonlinear CG, only the main diagonal of a Jacobian matrix
needs to be formed involving a distance-1 graph coloring algorithm and
an inexpensive modified colored finite difference scheme.<br>

The algorithm is implemented within Sandia National Laboratories' 
freely available parallel 'Trilinos' linear algebra
framework and makes use of it's smoothed aggregation multigrid 
library 'ML' and it's nonlinear solver
library 'NOX'.
The outline of the algorithm and implementation are given together 
with examples demonstrating the advantages
of this new approach. Several variants of the algorithm will be 
discussed and compared.
