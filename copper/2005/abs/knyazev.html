<br>Abstract
</center>
<p>
We present preliminary results of an ongoing project to develop codes of 
the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method
for symmetric eigenvalue problems for Hypre and PETSc software packages.
Hypre and PETSc packages provide high quality multigrid and domain 
decomposition
preconditioning on parallel clusters with distributed or shared memory 
architecture.
The LOBPCG method, suggested and developed by Andrew Knyazev [1] in the 
past decade,
recently attracts an increasing attention as a potential
alternative to the shift-and-invert Lanczos and preconditioned Davidson 
methods
due to its simplicity robustness and fast convergence.
Several MATLAB, C, C++ and FORTRAN implementations of the LOBPCG are 
developed by
different groups, e. g., for such applications
areas as structured mechanics and electronic structure calculations. 
However, the only publicly
available at present LOBPCG implementation
remains our implementation for Hypre, which is
already included in Hypre 1.8.2 release.
We describe the current state of the LOBPCG software for Hypre and PETSc,
developed by our group and demonstrate initial
scalability results.
