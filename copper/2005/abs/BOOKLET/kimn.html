<p>

A new type of overlapping Domain Decomposition algorithm, 
Overlapping Balancing Domain Decomposition (OBDD) algorithms, has been recently
presented by M. Sarkis and J.H. Kimn. This new algorithm can be considered as an
extension of the Balancing Domain Decomposition algorithms to overlapping subdomains.  

This approach can be applied to structured and unstructured meshes and relies on Partition of Unity function to construct a sparse matrix for coarse space. <br>



In this talk, we will discuss several aspects of the 
practical parallel implementation of this method. We will show numerical results for large unstructured meshes.
