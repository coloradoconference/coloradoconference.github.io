In this talk we consider two related approaches for solving linear systems
that arise from a higher-order finite element discretization of elliptic
partial differential equations. The first approach explores direct
application of an algebraic-based multigrid method (AMG) to iteratively
solve the linear systems that result from higher-order discretizations.
While the choice of basis used on the discretization has a significant
impact on the performance of the solver, results indicate that AMG is
capable of solving operators from both Poisson's equation and a first-order
system least-squares (FOSLS) formulation of Stoke's equation in a scalable
manner, nearly independent of basis order, p.   The second approach
incorporates preconditioning based on a bilinear finite element mesh
overlaying the entire set of degrees of freedom in the higher-order scheme.
AMG is applied to the operator based on the bilinear finite element
discretization and is used as a preconditioner in a conjugate gradient (CG)
iteration to solve the algebraic system derived from the high-order
discretization. This approach is also nearly independent of p.  We present
several numerical examples that support each method and discuss the
computational advantages of the preconditioning implementation.
