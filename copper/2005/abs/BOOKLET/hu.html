<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
In this talk we discuss a variety of practical tools that we have developed to
analyze and correct parallel multigrid performance.  These include
visualization capabilities for assessing aggregate quality, run time tools for
analyzing the convergence of existing multigrid methods, rebalancing schemes to
improve parallel communication patterns, and an adaptive multigrid method based
on that outlined in "Adaptive Smoothed Aggregation ($\alpha$SA)" by Brezina,
Falgout, Maclachlan, et. al.  We conclude with some examples from Sandia
applications where these tools have been applied.
