<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Numerical 
simulation of turbulent buoyancy driven plumes is characterized by two distinct 
length and time scales. Buoyancy induces large scale mixing of air and other 
species, forming a plume which can persist as an organized structure over large 
length scales. These large scale vortical structures have a puffing frequency 
that is inversely proportional to the square root of the length scales of these 
structures. The small scales tend to reduce the buoyant force by local mixing 
phenomena. Global refinement to capture the details at smaller length scales is 
not practical in many applications. Local mesh refinement provides an efficient 
alternative to global refinement. Motivation to simulate buoyant plumes and 
capture the salient flow features in the regions where small scale mixing occurs 
led us to develop a code with the capability of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR). 
The coupled AMR, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) procedure allows us to capture the 
information at the scales of the large structures with a higher fidelity and 
also the details which require a sub grid scale LES model.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%' align="justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Our approach uses 
a filtered form for the variable density incompressible flow equations that 
conserves both mass and momentum. We use a collocated grid for our computations. 
The projection formulation used avoids any velocity – pressure decoupling. The 
method is based on a projection formulation for momentum equations in which we 
first solve the advection – diffusion equations to predict intermediate 
velocities. We then project the velocities after interpolating them on to the 
faces to enforce the continuity constraint. This projection method successfully 
handles “large density” variations of ten to one observed in buoyant plume 
applications. This approach is implemented in SAMRAI (Structured Adaptive Mesh 
Refinement Application Infrastructure), an AMR framework from Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory (LLNL) developed for structured hierarchical grids. For 
solving the pressure poisson equation on a composite mesh, we use Fast Adaptive 
Composite (FAC) solver in SAMRAI, which is a multilevel solver. The FAC solver 
interfaces with HYPRE [developed at LLNL] linear solvers on the coarsest level. 
The time integration algorithm is a recursive procedure for each level of 
refinement. For this study, the criteria used for grid refinement is the 
gradient of the mass fraction of a specie.</span></p>

Verification and Validation of our method is done to assess its accuracy and 
reliability. Verification tests are carried out by using the analytical 
solutions for Eulers equation and Navier Stokes equations on a periodic box. 
These test examples demonstrate the accuracy and convergence properties of the 
algorithm. Validation of the code is carried out by demonstrating the 
performance of the method on a more relevant problem, in which a jet of light 
density fluid like Helium mixes in ambient air in the computational domain.</p>
