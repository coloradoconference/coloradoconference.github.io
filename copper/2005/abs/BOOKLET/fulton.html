<p>
Spherical geodesic grids offer several attractive features for geophysical
fluid dynamics modeling:  quasi-isotropic discretizations and quasi-uniform
resolution (which eliminates the pole problem of conventional
latitude-longitude grids).  Modeling fluid flow on such a grid results in
various elliptic problems which must be solved efficiently, e.g., the Poisson
problem relating streamfunction to vorticity and modified Helmholtz problems
with variable coefficients arising in semi-implicit time integration.

<p>
Heikes and Randall (1995) introduced a multigrid algorithm for the
two-dimensional Poisson problem on a spherical geodesic grid.  In this paper
we: (1) provide a smoothing analysis for this method and discuss possible
algorithmic improvements, (2) extend the algorithm to variable-coefficient
problems in two and three dimensions (using an isentropic vertical
coordinate), and (3) provide numerical experiments showing performance
consistent with the analysis.  We also illustrate the use of these multigrid
solvers in a three-dimensional dynamical core for a climate model.
