Optical flow and non-rigid registration of medical datasets lead
to a variational minimization problem that requires robust and
efficient numerical solvers.  Existing multigrid solvers for these
problems depend highly on the smoothness of the given image data.
Therefore the images are often smoothed before the computations. This
can lead to difficulties, e.g. when one tries to detect the motion of
very small objects. In order to handle non-smoothed image data we
apply several multigrid techniques, such as Galerkin coarsening and
matrix-dependent transfer operators. Further improvements can be
obtained by developing suitable line-wise and block-smoothers. Our
synthetic and real world results demonstrate that we can relax the
restrictions on the smoothness of the image data without loosing the
fast multigrid convergence rate. For high resolution 3D data it is
necessary to parallelize the algorithms.
