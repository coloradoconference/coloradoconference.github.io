    Generally robust multigrid codes, like BoxMG, employ Galerkin
coarsening to form the coarse grid operators. That is, if the fine
grid operator is $A$, then the coarse grid operator is $RAP$, where
$P$ is the interpolation operator from the coarse grid to the fine
grid, and $R$ is the restriction operator from the fine grid to the
coarse grid. In BoxMG, R is chosen as the transpose of P. This choice
minimizes the error in the range of interpolation. Also, in BoxMG,
interpolation is operator-induced, thereby approximately preserving
the continuity of the normal component of the flux across interfaces.

   Cell-centered discretizations on a logically structured grids are
readily treated with BoxMG by associating them with the corresponding
dual grid.  However, this approach does not preserve the cell based
structure on coarser levels.  Although this structure may not be
important in some applications, in the case of patch- or cell-based
mesh refinement, it is very desirable. Several multigrid methods have
been proposed to coarsen by cells, but these methods have been either
too costly or not robust with respect to fine-scale discontinuous
coefficients. For example coarsening by cells, using an
operator-induced piecewise bilinear interpolation for P, the transpose
of P for R, and forming the coarse grid operator as $RAP$ leads to
unacceptable stencil growth.  In contrast, Wesseling has investigated
a method that coarsens by cells, in which R is not the transpose of P,
yet under certain conditions RAP is symmetric; however, his use of a
non-operator-dependent P yields a method that is not as robust as
BoxMG. In this paper we explore the use of multiple dual-meshes on a
logically structured two-dimensional grid in conjunction with the
variational framework of BoxMG to create a robust method that coarsens
by cells while maintaining a 9-point coarse-grid operator on all
levels.  This approach readily extends to the cases of patch- and
cell-based refinement.
