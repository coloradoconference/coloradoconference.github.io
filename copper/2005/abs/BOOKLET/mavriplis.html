The last decade has seen rapid progress in the theoretical understanding,
algorithmic development, and use of lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM).
As opposed to traditional computational fluid dynamics approaches, which
compute macroscopic fluid dynamic properties by discretizing the continuum
governing equations, the independent variables in a lattice Boltzmann
approach consist of particle distribution functions in phase space,
from which macroscopic continuum fluid properties can be recovered.
Historically, LBM methods have been derived from lattice gas automata (LGA) methods.
LGA methods model macroscopic fluid motion through the evolution of a set of discrete
particles on a regular lattice (cartesian grid).
Many of the deficiencies of LGA methods in reproducing accurate
macroscopic behavior were resolved by the LBM approach, by
neglecting individual particle motion, and adopting
a particle distribution function approach.
However, LBM methods have retained this conceptual link to particle
methods such as LGA, which has inhibited the use of more sophisticated
numerical techniques.

In this work, we first describe the lattice
Boltzmann method as a particular finite-difference discretization in space
and time of the Boltzmann equation.  The LBM time-step
is then shown to be equivalent to a first-order explicit
time step (forward Euler), which is also equivalent to a Jacobi
iteration for the steady-state form of the LBM equations.
It is then shown how this iteration strategy may be used
as a solver for the steady-state lattice Boltzmann equation,
or as a solver for an implicit time-integration strategy.
Finally, it is shown how these problems may be solved
more efficiently using the Jacobi iteration as a smoother
in a multigrid scheme for the steady-state lattice
Boltzmann equation.  This requires under-relaxation of the
iteration scheme to achieve good high-frequency damping properties,
and a careful matching of the LBM discretizations on the coarse
grid levels, in order to ensure consistent coarse and fine
grid problems.  The final result is a multigrid solver
which can make use of a pre-existing LBM routine in a modular
fashion, by invoking the LBM routine on each grid level.
Convergence rates which are independent of the mesh resolution
are demonstrated for the driven cavity problem on a cartesian
grid, although the convergence rates degrade with
increasing Reynolds number.
