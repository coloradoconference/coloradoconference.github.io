<p>
We consider the numerical solution of elliptic and parabolic partial 
differential equations with stochastic coefficients. Such equations appear e.g. 
in reliability problems. Various approaches exist for dealing with such 
'uncertainty propagation' models: Monte Carlo methods, perturbation techniques, 
variance propagation, etc. Here, we deal with the stochastic finite element 
method (SFEM) [1]. This method transforms a system of PDEs with stochastic 
parameters into a stochastic linear system by means of a finite element Galerkin 
discretization. The stochastic solution vector of this system is approximated by 
a linear combination of deterministic vectors; the coefficients are orthogonal 
polynomials in the random variables. Unlike commonly used methods such as the 
perturbation method, the SFEM gives a result that contains all stochastic 
characteristics of the solution. It also improves Monte Carlo methods 
significantly because sampling can be done after solving the system of PDEs.</p>

In order to solve the discretized stochastic system that appears in the SFEM, 
stochastic versions of iterative methods can be applied, and their convergence 
can be accelerated by implementing them in a multigrid context [2]. In the work 
we present here, the convergence properties of these stochastic iterative 
methods and multigrid methods are investigated theoretically: deterministic 
(local) Fourier-mode analysis techniques are extended to the stochastic case by 
taking the eigenstructure into account of a matrix that depends on the random 
structure of the problem. This is equivalent to choosing an alternative set of 
polynomial basis functions in the random variables, which results in a 
decoupling of the original stochastic problem into a very large number of 
deterministic problems of the same type. The theoretical convergence rates that 
we obtain predict the results of numerical experiments very well, and the 
results of the analysis can also be used to design optimal stochastic multigrid 
algorithms.</p>
