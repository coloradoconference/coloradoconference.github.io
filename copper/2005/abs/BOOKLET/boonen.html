<br>Abstract
</center>
<p>

We consider algebraic multigrid methods for the numerical solution of 
curlcurl systems in computational electromagnetics.
Existing prolongation schemes for the curlcurl equation are often based
on the Reitzinger-Sch&ouml;berl prolongator presented in [1]. There, a
piecewise constant edge prolongator Pe is derived from a piecewise
constant nodal prolongator Pn, such that the commutation property is
satisfied. This prolongation scheme can be improved by applying ideas 
of smoothed aggregation multigrid to it ([2], [3]).

<p>

We will present an alternative prolongation scheme that takes as a starting point
an arbitrary partition of unity nodal prolongator Pn. We will show that
it is possible to associate with the set of coarse nodal elements 
(the columns of Pn) a set of coarse edge elements. The link between
both sets is the analytical formula for edge elements on triangular/tetrahedral 
meshes
<br>
<center>
   E<sub>ij</sub> = N<sub>i</sub> grad(N<sub>j</sub>) - N<sub>j</sub> grad(N<sub>i</sub>)
</center>
<br>
We will show that in the coarse setting, this formula has an exact 
discrete counterpart, which satisfies the commutation property. 
This prolongation schema contains the Reitzinger-Sch&ouml;berl edge prolongator 
as the special case for a piecewise constant nodal prolongator Pn.
