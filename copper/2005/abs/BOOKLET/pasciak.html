<P><BR>Abstract: We investigate some simple finite element discretizations for 
the axisymmetric Laplace equation and the azimuthal component of the 
axisymmetric Maxwell equations as well as multigrid algorithms for these 
discretizations. Our main result is that the standard V-cycle with point 
smoothing converges at a rate independent of the number of unknowns. This is 
contrary to suggestions in the existing literature that line relaxations and 
semicoarsening are needed in multigrid algorithms to overcome difficulties 
caused by the singularities in axisymmetric problems. Our multigrid analysis 
proceeds by applying the well known regularity based multigrid theory. In order 
to apply this theory, we prove regularity results for the axisymmetric Laplace 
and Maxwell equations in certain weighted Sobolev spaces. These, together with 
some new finite element error estimates in certain weighted Sobolev norms, are 
the main ingredients of our analysis.
