<p>
In this talk we discuss  AMG algorithms for eigenbasis approximation 
 for Schrodinger eigenvalue problems with variable potential. 
The algorithms employ the multilevel eigenvalue structure suggested by Livne and Brandt, and are used to solve one-dimensional (at O(NlogN) operations) and two-dimensional problems (at somewhat comparable costs). Also to be addressed is the issue of the quality of the approximated eigenbasis, such as its fullness and  independence of the eigenfunctions. Numerical results for both  one- and two-dimensional problems will be discussed.
