<p>
The use of high-order accurate spatial discretizations for simulating
steady and unsteady fluid flows has become more widespread over the last decade,
For unsteady simulations using high-order spatial discretizations
with a wide disparity between temporal and spatial
scales, higher-order implicit time-integration approaches are desirable.  However, such
approaches require the efficient solution of a non-linear problem at each time-step
in order to remain competitive.  In this work, we investigate the use of spectral
multigrid methods for driving implicit time-integration schemes of high-order discontinuous
Galerkin discretizations, using the linear two-dimensional wave equation as a model problem.
<p>
The method of lines is employed, in which the wave equation is first discretized
in space, resulting in a large set of coupled ordinary differential equations,
which are then discretized and integrated in time.
The Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method represents a spatial discretization approach
based on a finite-element method, which makes use of element
based basis functions which are discontinuous across element interfaces [1].
In this approach, the computational domain is partitioned into an ensemble of non-overlapping
elements and within each element the solution is approximately by a truncated polynomial expansion.
The solution is thus determined by the modal coefficients of the expansion in terms
of the basis functions within each element. Because the resulting solution representation
is discontinuous across element interfaces, an upwind numerical flux function is used to
resolve the discontinuity at element interfaces.
The current implementation uses a set of hierarchical basis functions on triangles [2],
enabling solutions
from 1st order (p=0), up to 4th order (p=3) spatial accuracy.
<p>
In order to solve the time-dependent problem, the resulting spatially
discretized equations must be integrated in time.
Although explicit time-integration schemes have been widely used for DG discretizations,
in this work we concentrate on the use of implicit time-integration schemes, which
are not restricted by the stability limit of explicit methods, and are more suitable
for stiff problems.
The implicit time-integration schemes employed in this work range from first to fourth-order accurate in time,
including both first and second order accurate
multistep backward difference formulas(BDF1, BDF2) and a fourth-order accurate implicit multistage
Runge-Kutta scheme. The use of implicit Runge-Kutta schemes represents an attempt to balance
the spatial and temporal orders of accuracy.
Moreover, even for second-order accurate finite-volume schemes,
fourth-order implicit Runge-Kutta schemes have been found to outperform
BDF2 schemes for engineering accuracy levels [3].
<p>
At each time-step, implicit time-integration methods require the solution
of one or more non-linear problems.  Efficient non-linear solvers are required
for this task in order to result in an overall competitive approach.
Our approach consists of using a spectral multigrid strategy [4,5] for solving
the implicit system at each time step.
The spectral or p-multigrid approach consists of a multigrid method
where the coarser levels are constructed by reducing the order of accuracy (p-coarsening)
while keeping the spatial grid resolution fixed (as opposed to h-coarsening).
Thus, for a p=3 (fourth-order accurate) spatial discretization, three coarser
multigrid levels are employed, consisting of p=2, p=1, and p=0 at the coarsest level.


At each p-multigrid level, an element-Jacobi scheme is used as a smoother.
The element Jacobi smoother can be viewed as an approximate Newton
method, where only the Jacobian entries corresponding to the modal coupling
within an element are retained, and all other entries are discarded,
resulting in a block diagonal matrix, which is easily inverted using
Gaussian elimination at the block level.
When used as a single grid solver, this smoother is shown to produce
p-independent convergence rates, with strong h-dependence.
When used as a smoother within the p-multigrid scheme, both h and p independent
convergence rates are obtained.
<p>
In the paper, we show both p and h independent convergence rates for the implicit
systems arising from the various time discretizations using the element Jacobi driven
spectral multigrid solver.  The overall efficiency and accuracy
of the various time-integration schemes are compared by examining the
error as a function of time for various time step sizes, where the
design accuracy of the respective time-integration schemes is demonstrated.
Further work will focus on extending this approach
to the unsteady Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.
