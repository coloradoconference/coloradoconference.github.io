<br>Abstract

<p>
The success of multigrid methods relies on complementarity between
the relaxation processs and the coarse-grid correction.
Multigrid methods are usually designed based on the assumption that
the error that needs to be eliminated by the coarse-grid correction
possesses smoothness.
<p>
We discuss several applications of practical interest where these
assumptions are violated, so standard approaches cannot be successfully
applied. We describe the recently developed extension of the smoothed
aggregation method, designed to identify the critical error
components and to incorporate them into the coarse space design.
The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that the method can
be used to achieve good convergence.
