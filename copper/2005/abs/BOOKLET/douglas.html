<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>DDDAS is a new paradigm in which data dynamically controls almost all
aspects of long term simulations.  Rather than run many simulations using
static data as initial conditions, a very small number of simulations are run
with additional data injected as it becomes available.  Most candidate
problems for the DDDAS paradigm involve solving a nonlinear time dependent
partial differential equation of the form F(x+d∆x(t)) = 0 by iteratively
choosing a new approximate solution x based on the time dependent perturbation
d∆x(t)</p>

<p>In practice, the data streaming in may have errors and therefore may not
be completely accurate or reliable (for example, in reservoir data sets, a 15%
error in the data is common).  As a result, perhaps one does not need to solve
the nonlinear equation precisely at each step.  This can expedite the
execution.</p>

<p>At each iterative step, the following three issues may need to be addressed:
<ol>
<li>Incomplete solves of a sequence of related models must be understood.</li>
<li>The effects of perturbations, either in the data and/or the model, need to
be resolved and kept within acceptable limits.</li>
<li>Nontraditional convergence issues have to be understood and resolved.</li>
</ol>
Consequently, there will be a high premium on developing quick approximate
direction choices, such as, lower rank updates and continuation methods, and
understanding their behavior are important issues.  Fault tolerant algorithms
have a premium.</p>

<p>The dynamic data is used to determine
<ol>
<li>Whether or not a warm restart is necessary due to unacceptable errors
building up in parts of the domain.</li>
<li>If a rollback in time is required.</li>
<li>If the simulation is running with acceptable errors.</li>
</ol>
Ideally, there does not have to be a human in the control loop throughout a
simulation.</p>

<p>Using the data appropriately lets the physical and mathematical models, the
discretization, and the scales of interesting parts of the computations become
parameters that can be changed during the course of the simulation.  In
addition, error propagation is of particular interest in nonlinear time
dependent simulations.</p>

<p>DDDAS offers interesting computational and mathematically unsolved
problems, such as, how do you analyze the properties of a generalized PDE when
you do not know either where or what the local boundary conditions are at any
given moment in the simulation in advance?</p>
