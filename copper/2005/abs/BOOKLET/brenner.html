<p>

Multigrid algorithms for C<sup>0</sup> interior penalty methods 
(which are discontinuous Galerkin methods) for fourth order problems 
will be discussed.  We will show that the convergence behavior of the 
multigrid algorithms is similar to that for second order problems,
provided that  we use a smoothing scheme involving a Poisson solve as a 
preconditioner.  Such a preconditioner can be easily implemented 
because the C<sup>0</sup> finite element spaces are standard spaces for 
second order problems.
