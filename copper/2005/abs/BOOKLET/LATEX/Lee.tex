Parallel methods are usually not applied to the time domain because of
the inherit sequentialness of time evolution. But for many evolutionary
problems, computer simulation can benefit substantially from time
parallelization methods. In this talk, we present several such
multilevel algorithms that actually exploit the sequential nature of
time evolution through a predictor-corrector procedure. This
sequentialness ensures convergence of a parallel predictor corrector
procedure within a fixed number of iterations. The performance of these
novel algorithms which can be derived from the classical alternating
Schwarz method, are illustrated through several examples from reservoir
simulation.
