Semi-implicit time discretization of the atmospheric primitive
equations results in a modified Helmholtz equation for the pressure.
Eigen-mode decomposition of the vertical structure matrix then gives
rise to independent problems for each vertical coordinate level.
Second-order finite differences are employed in the vertical and
high-order finite-elements in the horizontal direction. The independent
linear systems on each level are solved using Krylov iteration. Several
preconditioning strategies are investigated. An optimized Schwarz
method is compared to a new scheme related to the cell discretization
algorithm of Greenstadt. The latter yields dramatically improved
convergence rates and a reduction in computation time by eliminating
communication in matrix-vector products. The link with penalty and
discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems is established.
