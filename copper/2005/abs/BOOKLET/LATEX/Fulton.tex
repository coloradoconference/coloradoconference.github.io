Spherical geodesic grids offer several attractive features for
geophysical fluid dynamics modeling: quasi-isotropic discretizations
and quasi-uniform resolution (which eliminates the pole problem of
conventional latitude-longitude grids). Modeling fluid flow on such a
grid results in various elliptic problems which must be solved
efficiently, e.g., the Poisson problem relating streamfunction to
vorticity and modified Helmholtz problems with variable coefficients
arising in semi-implicit time integration.

Heikes and Randall (1995) introduced a multigrid algorithm for the
two-dimensional Poisson problem on a spherical geodesic grid. In this
paper we: (1) provide a smoothing analysis for this method and discuss
possible algorithmic improvements, (2) extend the algorithm to
variable-coefficient problems in two and three dimensions (using an
isentropic vertical coordinate), and (3) provide numerical experiments
showing performance consistent with the analysis. We also illustrate
the use of these multigrid solvers in a three-dimensional dynamical
core for a climate model.
