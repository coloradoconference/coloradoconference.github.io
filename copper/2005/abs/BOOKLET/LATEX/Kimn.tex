A new type of overlapping Domain Decomposition algorithm, Overlapping
Balancing Domain Decomposition (OBDD) algorithms, has been recently
presented by M. Sarkis and J.H. Kimn. This new algorithm can be
considered as an extension of the Balancing Domain Decomposition
algorithms to overlapping subdomains. This approach can be applied to
structured and unstructured meshes and relies on Partition of Unity
function to construct a sparse matrix for coarse space.

In this talk, we will discuss several aspects of the practical parallel
implementation of this method. We will show numerical results for large
unstructured meshes.
