Multigrid algorithms for $C^0$ interior penalty methods (which are
discontinuous Galerkin methods) for fourth order problems will be
discussed. We will show that the convergence behavior of the multigrid
algorithms is similar to that for second order problems, provided that
we use a smoothing scheme involving a Poisson solve as a
preconditioner. Such a preconditioner can be easily implemented because
the $C^0$ finite element spaces are standard spaces for second order
problems.
