Abstract: We investigate some simple finite element discretizations for
the axisymmetric Laplace equation and the azimuthal component of the
axisymmetric Maxwell equations as well as multigrid algorithms for
these discretizations. Our main result is that the standard V-cycle
with point smoothing converges at a rate independent of the number of
unknowns. This is contrary to suggestions in the existing literature
that line relaxations and semicoarsening are needed in multigrid
algorithms to overcome difficulties caused by the singularities in
axisymmetric problems. Our multigrid analysis proceeds by applying the
well known regularity based multigrid theory. In order to apply this
theory, we prove regularity results for the axisymmetric Laplace and
Maxwell equations in certain weighted Sobolev spaces. These, together
with some new finite element error estimates in certain weighted
Sobolev norms, are the main ingredients of our analysis.
