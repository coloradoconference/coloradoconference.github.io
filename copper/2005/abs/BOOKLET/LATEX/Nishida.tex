Abstract

When we need to compute the eigenvalues of a large sparse matrix
numerically, the projection method such as the Lanczos type or the
Davidson type methods has been the most orthodox choice. However,
recent studies revealed that the conjugate gradient method combined
with appropriate preconditioners can compute a few eigenpairs of such
problems quite efficiently. For large scale nonsymmetric eigenproblems,
we expand this approach to the conjugate residual and the bi-conjugate
gradient type methods, and evaluate the combination with the AMG
preconditioner.
