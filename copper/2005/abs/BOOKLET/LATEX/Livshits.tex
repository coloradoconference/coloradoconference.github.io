In this talk we discuss AMG algorithms for eigenbasis approximation for
Schrodinger eigenvalue problems with variable potential. The algorithms
employ the multilevel eigenvalue structure suggested by Livne and
Brandt, and are used to solve one-dimensional
(at $O(N\log N)$ operations)
and two-dimensional problems (at somewhat comparable costs). Also to be
addressed is the issue of the quality of the approximated eigenbasis,
such as its fullness and independence of the eigenfunctions. Numerical
results for both one- and two-dimensional problems will be discussed.
