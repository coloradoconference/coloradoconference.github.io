Optical flow and non-rigid registration of medical datasets lead to a
variational minimization problem that requires robust and efficient
numerical solvers. Existing multigrid solvers for these problems depend
highly on the smoothness of the given image data. Therefore the images
are often smoothed before the computations. This can lead to
difficulties, e.g., when one tries to detect the motion of very small
objects. In order to handle non-smoothed image data we apply several
multigrid techniques, such as Galerkin coarsening and matrix-dependent
transfer operators. Further improvements can be obtained by developing
suitable line-wise and block-smoothers. Our synthetic and real world
results demonstrate that we can relax the restrictions on the
smoothness of the image data without loosing the fast multigrid
convergence rate. For high resolution 3D data it is necessary to
parallelize the algorithms.
