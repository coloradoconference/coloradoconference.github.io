The problem of unstructured mesh smoothing can be approached by solving
a set of Laplace-Beltrami equations that are discretized using finite
elements. The resulting discrete problem is non-linear and a
Newton-Krylov type procedure can be employed to solve it. We will
report on our efforts to speed up the solution of this problem using an
AMG based preconditioner in the Krylov step.
