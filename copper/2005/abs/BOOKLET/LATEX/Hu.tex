In this talk we discuss a variety of practical tools that we have
developed to analyze and correct parallel multigrid performance. These
include visualization capabilities for assessing aggregate quality, run
time tools for analyzing the convergence of existing multigrid methods,
rebalancing schemes to improve parallel communication patterns, and an
adaptive multigrid method based on that outlined in ``Adaptive Smoothed
Aggregation ($\alpha$SA)'' by Brezina, Falgout, Maclachlan, et. al. We
conclude with some examples from Sandia applications where these tools
have been applied.
