Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the problem of deducing unambiguous
``phase'' from values known only modulo $2\pi$. Many authors agree that
the objective of phase unwrapping should be to find a weighted minimum
of the number of places where adjacent (discrete) phase values differ
by more than $\pi$. This NP-hard problem is of considerable practical
interest, largely due to its importance in interpreting data acquired
with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. Consequently, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed. In this talk we shall present
a novel multi-level graph algorithm for the approximate solution of
this problem via an equivalent problem: minimal residue cut in the dual
graph.
