<p>The Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Method is increasingly used
nowadays to solve advection-dominated problems. Its most
attractive features, namely the high accuracy obtained without the
use of an extended stencil and the inherent parallelization, have
turned it into a method of choice for Computational Fluid Dynamics
problems (see the recent review in [Cockburn,Karniadakis,Shu (2001)]). 
The early formulation of the DG method by Cockburn and Shu (1989) 
uses as degrees of freedom the coefficients of the
solution in a polynomial basis expansion (Legendre polynomials
being used in one dimension to take advantage of their
orthogonality). This modal formulation seems more intuitive, but
has a large drawback for nonlinear problems: to compute nonlinear
fluxes, one needs to first compute the value of the solution by
evaluating the polynomial expansion at the flux integration
points, then evaluate the fluxes. Researchers realized later that
this translation from modal space into physical space can be
avoided through a collocation (nodal) formulation. In the latter
framework the degrees of freedom are the values of the solution at
the collocation points, so the flux values can be evaluated
easily, in particular if the collocation points are chosen to
coincide with the integration points
[Stanescu,Hussaini,Farassat (2003)],
[Kopriva,Woodruff,Hussaini (2001)].</p>

<p>In the context of multigrid methods, the modal DG formulation again is more 
  intuitive: the polynomial-type basis functions can be made hierarchical, and 
  a <i>p</i>-multigrid approach is natural (the restriction operator for example 
  just neglects extra modes); see recent research in this direction [Helenbrook,Mavriplis,Atkins 
  (2003)], [Fidkowski,Darmofal (2003)]. Due to the advantage of the nodal approach 
  for nonlinear problems, we want to investigate the feasibility of a <i>p</i>-type 
  multigrid method in this latter formulation. It seems that such an investigation 
  has not been reported yet in the literature. The use of an acceleration technique 
  such as multigrid may reduce the difference in cost between the two approaches; 
  however, this is very likely to be problem dependent, hence arguably a nodal 
  DG <i>p</i>-multigrid method may lead to savings in computer time.</p>

<p>For a preliminary numerical result, we solve the one-dimensional nonlinear 
  Euler equations and compare the performance (CPU time, MG cycles) of a nodal 
  DG <i>p</i>-multigrid with a modal DG <i>p</i>-multigrid. Figure 1 shows the accuracy versus the number of MG
cycles. Figure 2 shows the accuracy versus CPU time.</p>
