<br>Abstract
</center>

<p>
The notion of <i>compatible relaxation</i> (CR) was introduced by Brandt in [1]
as a modified relaxation scheme that keeps the coarse-level variables
invariant.  Brandt stated that the convergence rate of CR is a general measure
for the quality of the set of coarse variables.  A supporting theory for these
ideas was presented in [2], from which we developed a CR-based algebraic
coarsening algorithm for use in algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods.  In [3], a
new sharp convergence theory was developed for AMG.  The form of this new
theory bears a striking resemblance to its predecessor and suggests the
possibility of improving the CR measure.

<p>
In this talk, we will use the relationship between these two theories to
motivate a new approach for CR, one that has the potential of being a sharper
measure of coarse grid quality and a better predictor of AMG convergence (one
specific version of this method was suggested by Livne [4]).  We will discuss
the theoretical properties of the new method, provide some numerical results,
and discuss open questions and future directions.
