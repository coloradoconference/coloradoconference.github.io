<p>
Semi-implicit time discretization of the atmospheric primitive 
equations results in a modified Helmholtz equation for the pressure.
Eigen-mode decomposition of the vertical structure matrix then 
gives rise to independent problems for each vertical coordinate
level.  Second-order finite differences are employed in the vertical
and high-order finite-elements in the horizontal direction.  The 
independent linear systems on each level are solved using Krylov 
iteration. Several preconditioning strategies are investigated. An
optimized Schwarz method is compared to a new scheme related to 
the cell discretization algorithm of Greenstadt.  The latter yields 
dramatically improved convergence rates and a reduction in computation 
time by eliminating communication in matrix-vector products.  The 
link with penalty and discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic
problems is established.
