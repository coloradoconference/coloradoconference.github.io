<p>
The development of optimal, or near optimal solution strategies for
higher-order discretizations, including steady-state solutions
methodologies, and implicit time integration strategies, remains one
of the key determining factors in devising higher-order methods
which are not just competitive but superior to lower-order methods
in overall accuracy and efficiency. The goal of this work is to investigate
and develop a fast and robust algorithm for the solution of
high-order accurate Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of
non-linear systems of conservation laws on unstructured grids.
Herein we extend the spectral multigrid approach
described in [1] to the two-dimensional steady-state Euler
equations, and couple the spectral <i>p</i>-multigrid approach with a more
traditional agglomeration <i>h</i>-multigrid method for unstructured
meshes. The investigation of efficient smoothers to be used at each
level of the multigrid algorithm is also pursued, and comparisons
between linear and non-linear solver strategies are made as well [2].
The overall goal is the development of a solution algorithm which
delivers convergence rates which are independent of <i>``p"</i> (the order of
accuracy of the discretization) and independent of <i>``h"</i> (the degree of
mesh resolution), while minimizing the cost of each iteration.
<p>
The computational domain is partitioned into an ensemble
of non-overlapping unstructured elements and within each
element the solution is approximated by a truncated polynomial expansion.
The semi-discrete formulation employs a local discontinuous Galerkin
formulation in spatial variables within each element. Thus, the solution approximation
is local, discontinuous, and doubled valued on each elemental interface.
Monotone numerical fluxes are used to resolve the discontinuity,
providing the means of communication between adjacent elements and
specification of the boundary conditions. An approximate Riemann solver
is used to compute the flux at inter-element boundaries.
The discrete form of the local discontinuous Galerkin formulation is
defined by the particular choice of the set of basis functions.
Hereby a set of hierarchical basis functions is used in order to simplify
our subsequent spectral multigrid implementation. The full description of 
the basis function set is given in [3]. The resulting set of equations 
is solved in the modal space and the integrals are evaluated 
by Gaussian quadrature rules.
<p>
The spectral <i>p</i>-multigrid approach is based on the same concepts as a
traditional <i>h</i>-multigrid method, but makes use of ``coarser''
levels which are constructed by reducing the order of accuracy of
the discretization, rather than  using physically coarser grids with
fewer elements. Furthermore, the formulation of the
interpolation operators, between fine and coarse grid levels, is
greatly simplified when a hierarchical basis set is employed for the
solution approximation. The main advantage is due to the fact that
the lower order basis functions are a subset of the higher order basis
(<i>i.e.</i> hierarchical) and the <i>restriction</i> and 
<i>prolongation</i> operators become simple projection operators into a
lower and higher order space, respectively [4].
For pure <i>p</i>-multigrid methods, the recursive
application of lower order discretizations ends with the <i>p=0</i>
discretization on the same grid as the fine level problem.  For
relatively fine meshes, the (exact) solution of this <i>p=0</i> problem
at each multigrid cycle can become expensive, and may impede the
<i>h</i>-independence property of the multigrid strategy. The <i>p=0</i> problem
can either be solved approximately by employing the same number of
smoothing cycles on this level as on the finer <i>p</i>-levels, or 
it can be solved more accurately by performing a larger
number of smoothing cycles at each visit to this coarsest level. In
either case, the convergence efficiency will be compromised, either
due to inadequate coarse level convergence, or due to excessive coarse
level solution cost. An alternative is to employ an <i>h</i>-multigrid
procedure to solve the coarse level problem at each multigrid cycle.
In this scenario, the <i>p</i>-multigrid scheme reverts to an agglomeration
multigrid scheme once the <i>p=0</i> level has been reached, making use
of a complete sequence of physically coarser agglomerated grids, thus
the designation <i>hp</i>-multigrid. First-order accurate (<i>p=0</i>)
agglomeration multigrid methods for unstructured meshes are well
established [5] and deliver near optimal convergence rates. Therefore, this
procedure has the potential of resulting in a truly <i>h</i>- and <i>p</i>-independent 
solution strategy for high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin discretizations.
<p>
At each <i>h</i>- or <i>p</i>-multigrid level an element-Jacobi type scheme 
is used as a smoother. The element-Jacobi scheme can be viewed as an approximate
Newton scheme where the full Jacobian matrix is replaced by the
block diagonal entries representing the coupling between all modes
within each element, [D], thus neglecting the coupling between 
neighboring element modes, which arises through the inter-element flux evaluations.
The [D] blocks represent small dense matrices associated with each grid
element. A second variant of this solver is denoted as the ``linearized" 
element-Jacobi method. In this approach, the full Jacobian matrix is retained, 
but is decomposed into block diagonal [D] and off-diagonal [O] components.

Note that the linearized element Jacobi scheme involves a
dual iteration strategy, where each <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> outer non-linear
iteration entails <i>``k"</i> inner linear iterations. The advantage of this
formulation is that the non-linear residual and the
Jacobian entries, [D] and [O], are held constant during the
linear iterations. This can significantly reduce the required
computational time per cycle for expensive non-linear residual
constructions. Because this scheme represents an exact linearization
of the element-Jacobi scheme both approaches can
be expected to converge asymptotically at the same rates per cycle [6]. 
The convergence can be further accelerated by using a Gauss-Seidel 
strategy where the off-diagonal matrices are split into lower, 
[L], and upper, [U] contributions (<i>i.e.</i> [O]=[L]+[U]). 
This last solver variant, again, involves a dual iteration strategy, 
but follows an ordered sweep across the elements using latest available
neighboring information in the Gauss-Seidel sense. In this work, we
employ a frontal sweep along the elements which begins near the
inner boundary and proceeds toward the outer boundary, using the
numbering assigned to the grid elements from an advancing front mesh
generation technique.
<p>
The resulting <i>hp</i>-multigrid scheme demonstrates 
<i>p</i>-independent and nearly <i>h</i>-independent convergence rates.
The coupling of <i>p</i>- and <i>h</i>-multigrid procedures, through
the use of agglomerated coarse levels for unstructured meshes,
increases the overall solution efficiency compared to a <i>p</i>-alone
multigrid procedure, and the benefits of the <i>hp</i>-multigrid
approach can be expected to increase for finer meshes.
The multigrid procedure can itself be applied as a non-linear
solver (FAS), or as a linear solver (CGC) for a Newton scheme applied
to the non-linear problem. The linear multigrid approach
demonstrates superior overall efficiency, provided
a suitable linear iteration termination strategy is employed.
Results are presented for compressible flow over a bump in a channel
and for flow over a four element airfoil in two dimensions.
