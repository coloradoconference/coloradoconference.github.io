stems of linear equations (KKT systems) arise in many applications from conta\
ct in solid mechanics and incompressible flow, to problems in mathematical op\
timization for PDE systems. Several approaches have been developed for solvin\
g these systems, given a solver for the primal part of the system: 1) constra\
int reduction, 2) projection methods, and 3) Uzawa/augmented Lagrange. All of\
 these methods have advantages and disadvantages. Uzawa methods are robust an\
d scalable though they require several approximate solves, as they iterate on\
 the Shur complement. Constraint reduction is effective for certain types of \
constraints, but is limited in its applicability. Projection methods are attr\
active as they handle general constraints and are simple to use with an exist\
ing solver or preconditioner, but they are generally not scalable nor are the\
y robust when used with powerful preconditioners, such as multigrid. <p> Alge\
braic multigrid is a popular method for solving the equations that arise from\
 discretized PDEs, the primal part of KKT systems, but the application of mul\
tigrid to the entire KKT system has not been investigated to a great degree. \
V.H. Schulz has recently applied structured geometric multigrid to optimizati\
on problems, S.P. Vanka has developed structured geometric multigrid techniqu\
es for incompressible flow problems, and a commercial product (TaskFlow) has \
developed an algebraic (aggregation) multigrid method for unstructured incomp\
ressible flow problems. Multigrid methods are attractive for constrained syst\
ems as they have the potential to be both highly optimal like constraint redu\
ction and general like projection methods by maintaining tight coupling of th\
e constraints in the preconditioning process while not requiring that the pri\
mal part of the system be augmented by regularization as in Uzawa methods or \
a Shur complement as in constraint reduction. <p> This talk discusses the app\
lication of algebraic multigrid techniques to discretized PDEs with constrain\
ts. We describe a framework for developing algebraic multigrid methods for KK\
T systems and discuss coarsening techniques for the constraint equations. We \
cover several approaches to constructing multigrid smoothers and present exam\
ples of application of some of these ideas to contact problems in solid mecha\
nics. </html>^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+1"><b>2. David Alber</b></font><br>^J&n\

Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method</u>, <u> SIAM Journal on Scien\

ion 1.6.0. The user interface to the solver is implemented ~  using HYPRE sty\
le object oriented function calls. The matrix-vector multiply and the precond\

 <p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> The quality of numerical simulation\
s of processes that are modeled by partial differential equations strongly de\
pends on the quality of the mesh that is used for their discretization. This \
quality is affected, for example, by mesh smoothness, or discretization error\
. To improve the mesh, a functional that is in general nonlinear must be mini\
mized (for example, the $L\^2$ approximation error on the mesh). This minimiz\
ation is constrained by the validity of the mesh, since no mesh folding is al\
lowed. Classical techniques, such as nonlinear CG, perform very poorly on thi\
s class of minimization problems. We will introduce a new minimization techni\
que that utilizes the underlying geometry of the problem. By coarsening the m\
esh successively, in a multilevel-like fashion, minimizing appropriate coarse\
 grid quality measures, and interpolating finer meshes from coarser ones, a m\
ore rapid movement of fine mesh points results, and the overall convergence o\
f the minimization procedure is accelerated. </html>^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+\

p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> The eigenfunctions of a differential \
operator (or a discretized differential operator, or a matrix of a similar ty\
pe) need not each be separately represented. A compact multilevel collective \
structure can be organized, in which many eigenfunctions have the same fine-l\
evel representation; they are distinguished only in the way in which that rep\
resentation is mollified, where the mollification is a point-by-pont multipli\
cation by a smooth function which is represented on the next coarser grid. At\
 that coarser level, many of the mollification functions can again use a comm\
on representation, etc., so at increasingly coarser levels more and more eige\
nsets are separated out, each becoming progressively more specific. <p> This \
makes it possible to calculate N eigenfunctions in just O(N log N) computer o\
perations, using only O(N log N) storage. By comparison, a usual multigrid ei\
gensolver would require at least O(N**3) operations and O(N**2) storage. More\
over the multiscale eigenbasis (MEB) structure allows to expand any given fun\
ction in terms of the N eigenfunctions in again just O(N log N) operations. T\
his is a vast generalization of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which achie\
ves the same complexity order (with a smaller prefactor), but is limited to t\
he eigenbasis of differential operators with constant coefficients, periodic \
boundary conditions and uniform discretization. <p> The multiplicative Galerk\
in mode of coarsening the eigenproblem avoids certain flaws in classical mult\
igrid eigensolvers: it yields coarse equations that have themselves the form \
of an eigenproblem, whose eigenvectors correspond one-to-one to fine eigenvec\
tors; orthogonalizations need only be performed at coarse levels; and arbitra\
rily coarse grids can be employed even in calculating high eigenfunctions. Th\
is mode is particularly natural and useful for algebraic multigrid (AMG), sin\
ce it involves construction of the intergrid interpolation operators. <p> The\
 MEB structure also allows very efficient eigen calculations in unbounded dom\
ains for operators that have asymptotically constant or periodic coefficients\
, which is the usual situation in many applications, including molecular and \
condensed-matter electronic structure calculations. <p> The work is a collabo\
ration in progress with Drs. Oren Livne and Ira Livshits. </html> ^J^J^J^J<hr\

 <p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> Substantial effort has been focused\
 over the last two decades on developing multilevel iterative methods capable\
 of solving the large linear systems encountered in engineering practice. The\
se systems often arise from discretizing partial differential equations over \
unstructured meshes, and the particular parameters or geometry of the physica\
l problem being discretized may be unavailable to the solver. Algebraic multi\
level methods have been of particular interest in this context because of the\
ir promises of optimal performance without the need for explicit knowledge of\
 the problem geometry. These methods construct a hierarchy of coarse problems\
 based on the linear system itself and on certain assumptions about the low-e\
nergy components of the error. <p> For smoothed aggregation methods applied t\
o discretizations of elliptic problems, these assumptions typically consist o\
f knowledge of the near-nullspace of the weak form. We describe a recently de\
veloped extension of the smoothed aggregation method in which good convergenc\
e properties are achieved in situations where explicit knowledge of the near-\
nullspace components may be unavailable. This extension is accomplished by us\
ing the method itself to determine near-nullspace components when none are pr\
ovided. The coarsening process is modified to use and improve the computed co\
mponents. <p> Numerical experiments include test problems arising in the LANL\
's hydrocode SAGE, featuring cell-centered discretization, automatic mesh ref\
inement and coefficient discontinuities. </html> ^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+1">\

first-order partial differential systems: the stress-displacement and the str\

order systems are converted into second-order partial differential systems wi\

hen based on these well-known second-order systems. Although substantial prog\
ress in numerical methods and in computations has been achieved, these proble\
ms may still be difficult and expensive to solve. In this talk, we will first\
 derive the stress-velocity formulation for incompressible Newtonian fluid fl\
ows since the pressure can be represented in terms of the normal stresses. We\
 will then introduce a least-squares method applied to the first-order system\
: the stress-displacement (velocity) formulation. The principal attractions o\
f our least-squares method include freedom in the choice of finite element sp\

p> Multiscale modeling of materials requires simulations of multiple levels o\

omes a critical factor for simulating large physical systems with highly desp\
erate length scales. A flow with small particles represents a particularly di\
fficult problem for efficient multigrid solution. These particles are often s\
o small, occupying just a few points on the fine grid, that they cannot be pr\
operly incorporated into a coarse-grid formulation. Efficiency, i.e., converg\
ence rate, of classical multigrid solvers deteriorates significantly because \
of the poor accuracy of coarse-grid approximations. <br> In this talk, I am p\
lanning to overview and evaluate several existing multigrid approaches to sol\
ving problems with small particles. A new multigrid method based on a modifie\

 recovering the optimal (Laplace-like) efficiency in solution of practically \
interesting problems. </html> ^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+1"><b>16. Craig C. Dou\

<p> In recent years, much work has been done to increase the robustness of Al\
gebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods. The classical AMG method of Ruge and St&uuml\
;ben [5] used heuristics based on properties of M-matrices. Although this alg\
orithm works remarkably well for a wide variety of problems [3], the M-matrix\
 assumption still limits its applicability. To address this, a new class of a\
lgorithms was developed based on multigrid theory: AMGe [1], element-free AMG\
e [4], and spectral AMGe [2]. All of these algorithms assume a basic framewor\
k in their construction. Namely, they assume that relaxation is a simple poin\
twise method, then they build the coarse-grid correction step to eliminate th\
e so-called <i>algebraically smooth</i> error left over by the relaxation pro\
cess. In the AMGe methods above, this is done with the help of a <i>measure</\
i> (or weak-approximation property) that defines the approximation property t\
hat interpolation must satisfy in order to achieve uniform convergence assumi\
ng a pointwise relaxation. <p> In this talk, we introduce a new measure for c\
onstructing algebraic multigrid methods. The purpose of this new measure is t\
o generalize the AMG framework to include problems such as Maxwell's Equation\
s, which has a particularly large null-space when discretized using the commo\
n N&eacute;d&eacute;lec finite elements. In the old framework, it is necessar\
y to take all O(N) of these null-space components to the coarse grid, which r\
esults in a non-optimal method. This problem can be overcome by using somethi\
ng other than pointwise relaxation to damp a subspace of these near-null-spac\
e components on the fine grid. Examples include overlapping block relaxation \
or the so-called Hiptmair smoother (Brandt's distributive relaxation). The me\
asure proposed here takes into account the smoothing process and changes the \
AMGe heuristic in a subtle but important way. The hope is that this new measu\
re will allow us to develop AMG methods that can handle difficult problems su\
ch as Maxwell's equations or Helmholtz. <p> This work was performed under the\

 <p> <b>Abstract </b> </CENTER> <p> A <i>direct</i> partial differential prob\
lem involves an interior differential equation and a set of initial and/or bo\
undary conditions which stably determines a unique solution. An<i> inverse</i\
> problem is one in which the differential equation and/or initial and/or bou\
ndary conditions are not fully given and instead the results of a set of solu\
tion observations (measurements) are known. They may contain errors, and even\
 without errors the problem is usually ill-posed: the known data may be appro\
ximated by widely different solutions, but the ill-posedness of an inverse pr\
oblem does not necessarily imply more expensive solution process. On the cont\
rary: once the nature of the ill-posedness has been generally understood, to \
solve an inverse problem may even be much less expensive than to solve a corr\
esponding direct problem. I am going to demonstrate this methodological point\
 on an example of inverse problem for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). \
<p> An EIT device for medical use consists of a set of electrodes attached to\
 the chest of a patient. A small <i>known</i> current is passed between two d\
river electrodes. In each measurement a current is passed through a different\
 electrode pair, while the voltage drops at <i>all </i>the electrodes are rec\
orded. The collected data are used in order to compute the conductivity distr\
ibution in a part of the patient's chest and then to display it on a screen i\
n order to detect anomalies, such as tumors. The electrical potential satisfi\
es the equation &Ntilde;~*(s&Ntilde;<i>u</i>)=0, where s is an electrical con\
ductivity. The set of measurements gives ideally (in the limit of many small \
electrodes and as many measurements) the <i>Neumann to Dirichlet</i> mapping:\
 the Dirichlet <i> u</i> boundary condition resulting from any Neumann ~6<i>u\
</i>/~6<b>n</b> condition. The inverse problem is to evaluate s from this map\
ping. The conductivity depends on the EIT data in a very weak way. Therefore \
the inverse problem of EIT is ill-posed. <p> There exist some works on numeri\
cal methods for the relevant problems, but their number is rather sparse and \
even those papers do not consider the question of numerical efficiency, despi\
te its importance for applications. In this specific inverse EIT problem, emp\
loying local Fourier decompositions, we have shown that all conductivity-func\
tion components of wavelenght l are ill-posed at distances <i>r</i>&gt;&gt;l \
from the boundary. Hence there is no need to use at such distances fine solut\
ion grids, since all we can know about the solution can be calculated with gr\
ids whose meshsizes increase proportionality to <i>r</i>. <p> Two multigrid s\
olvers for this problem are presented: <p> The <b>first multigrid solver</b> \
uses the Tikhonov regularization technique. The inverse problem is reformulat\
ed as a variational minimization problem. The resulting Euler equations form \
a PDE system (for <i> u</i>, s and Lagrange multipliers), which makes the pro\
blem suitable in principle for an effective numerical solution by multigrid m\
ethods. The multigrid solver starts with large and then procceds to progressi\
vely smaller regularization parameters. Many features of classical multigrid \
were adapted to this particular problem (such as intergrid communications, bo\
undary condition treatment and coarse grid solution). <p> In the case of a la\
rge regularization parameter, numerical results demonstrate a good convergenc\
e of the developed solver, but the obtained solution is too smeared and doesn\
't approximate the real conductivity too well. At small regularization the fi\
nal approximation is much better, especially near the boundary. However, in t\
his case the system is no longer elliptic and for efficiency the multigrid so\
lver must use more sophisticated relaxation scheme, which effectively decompo\
ses the system into its scalar factors. Although the multigrid cycles assympt\
otically slow down, the final approximation to the <i>conductivity</i> is obt\
ained by just one multigrid cycle per grid refinement even for the smallest r\
egularization for which solution still exists. <p> In the <b>second multigrid\
 solver </b>a regularization in the classical sense is replaced by <i>a caref\
ul choice of grids</i>. In order to avoid introducing ill-posed components in\
to the current approximation, changes to the solution far from the measuremen\
ts are calculated only on coarse enough grids (with meshsizes at least compar\
able to the distance from the measurements), which only define large-scale <i\
>averages </i>of the solution. On the other hand, near the boundary of measur\
ements we introduce both high and low oscillatory components to the solution.\
 For this we use semi-coarsening in the direction parallel to the boundary of\
 measurements and full-coarsening in the perpendicular direction. <p> The alg\
orithm is based on three main principles: 1) due to the ill-posedness, the co\
mputational work on the grid of meshsize <i>h</i> should only be done near th\
e boundary, at distances <i>O(h)</i> from it; 2) similar changes introduced i\
nto s at the different <i>O(h)</i> distances from the boundary of measurement\
s cause <i>very different</i> changes in <i> u</i> on this boundary &THORN; f\
or smooth Fourier components in <i>y</i> a full coarsening (both in <i>x</i> \
and <i>y</i>) does not resolve these differences, hence we must use <i>a semi\
 coarsening</i> in <i>y </i>direction (i.e. without coarsening the meshsize i\
n the <i>x</i> direction); 3) it is necessary to start always from the <i> be\
tter-posed</i> changes &THORN; in each cycle (FMG, V-cycle, W-cycle, semi-cyc\
le) we introduce changes to the current approximation first on the coarsest (\
or semi-coarsest) grid, where those changes are well-posed, and only after th\
at changes from the finer grids. <p> Numerical <b>results</b> show that the s\
econd algorithm approximates s <i> better</i> than the regularized method wit\
h its many artificial parameters (the regularization coefficients, which shou\
ld change over the domain), for less work (no Lagrange multipliers). The accu\
racy of both algorithm, in particular near the boundary of measurements, is n\
early the same. But the second algorithm does not use any regularization in a\
 classical sense, and as a result significant space and time saving is achiev\
ed. In this algorithm there is no need to solve a large system of discretized\
 differential equations and boundary conditions; also, no Lagrange-multiplier\
 equations need to be treated. ^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+1"><b>22. Roland Glow\

ed by designing data structures with respect to state-of-the-art computer arc\

have to be solved several thousand times inside the solution process of an in\

example, one approach is to iteratively solve the fluid equations on a fixed \
domain, apply the fluid stresses from the fluid solution to an elastic solid,\
 and remap the fluid domain based on the displacement of the elastic solid. A\
t the other extreme, the full system of equations (fluid, elastic, and mappin\
g/meshing) can be solved simultaneously using a Newton iteration. There are a\
dvantages and disadvantages to each approach, and the choices effect the perf\

discretization of the FOSLS formulation results in a SPD matrix problem that \
is solved using AMG. With AMG, only a single Newton iteration is required for\
 each refinement beyond the course grid to achieve an accurate discrete solut\

 Abstract </center> <p> Selective multigrid has higher order of interpolation\
 and prolongation operators in comparison with standard aggregative multigrid\
. These properties provide better convergence rate for selective multigrid bu\
t come at price of a longer setup phase. A question what solver is faster can\
't be answered without direct comparison of both solvers under a specified co\
nvergence criteria. <br> The selective multigrid has been implemented followi\
ng J.W.Ruge and K.Stueben's works. The standard coarsening scheme was used an\
d the direct and standard interpolations were tried. The standard interpolati\
on is more exact but more expensive in time and memory. <br> The convergence \
and running time of the selective multigrid were compared with that of the We\
iss et al's aggregative multigrid. Both solvers were applied to a test proble\
m based on a diffusivity equation and to a few matrices built from a pressure\
 equation for some CFD problems. Their performance is analyzed based on reduc\
tion of residuals by one and six order of magnitude. <p> References: <p> Stue\

p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> Finite element problems posed on larg\
e unstructured grids arise naturally in simulations, where only a very fine d\
iscretization of the domain is available. In order to achieve performance com\
parable with multilevel methods for the geometrically refined case, one can u\
se an algebraic solver based on sequence of coarsened meshes. <p> In this tal\
k we present a possible parallelization of one such algorithm - the agglomera\
tion based algebraic multigrid for finite element problems (AMGe). The method\
 starts with a partitioning of the original domain into subdomains with a gen\
erally unstructured finite element mesh on each subdomain. The agglomeration \
based AMGe is then applied independently in each subdomain. It needs access t\
o the local stiffness matrices which are (variationally) constructed after co\
arsening. Note that even if one starts with a conforming fine grid, independe\
nt coarsening generally leads to non-matching grids on the coarser levels. We\
 use an element-based dual basis mortar finite element method in order to set\
 up global problems on each level. Since the considered AMGe produces abstrac\
t elements and faces defined as lists of nodes, the mortar multiplier spaces \
are also constructed in a purely algebraic way. This construction requires in\
version of the local mass matrices on each interface boundary shared between \
two subdomains, which is possible because of the way AMGe agglomerates the fa\
ces. Finally, a multigrid-preconditioned solver is applied to the resulting s\
equence of (non-nested) spaces. The talk will conclude with set of numerical \
results illustrating the computational behavior of this new algebraic multigr\
id algorithm. <p> This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Depa\

 <p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> We consider an algebraic multilevel\
 preconditioning method for SPD matrices resulting from finite element discre\
tization of elliptic PDEs. The method is based on element agglomeration, and,\
 in particular, designed for non-M matrices. Granted that the element matrice\
s at the fine-grid level are given, we further assume that we have access to \
some algorithm that performs a reasonable agglomeration of fine-grid elements\
 at any given level. The coarse-grid element matrices are simply Schur comple\
ments computed from the locally assembled fine-grid element matrices, i.e., a\
gglomerate matrices. Hence, these matrices can be assembled to a global appro\
ximate Schur complement. The elimination of fine-degrees of freedom in the ag\
glomerate matrices is done without neglecting any fill-in. This offers the op\
portunity to construct a new kind of incomplete LU factorization of the pivot\
 matrix at every level, which is done by means of a slightly modified assembl\
ing process. Based on these components an algebraic multilevel preconditioner\
 can be defined for more general SPD matrices. The method can also be applied\
 to systems of PDEs. A numerical analysis shows its efficiency and robustness\

relying on its algebraic relations. Although AMG is widely employed, e.g. for\
 solving second-order elliptic discretized PDEs with disordered coefficients \
on unstructured grids, its scope is rather limited to these cases. However, A\
MG may be remedied, by systemtically understanding and improving its ingredie\
nts: relaxation, coarse levels and inter-level transfers. We present a novel \
approach for selecting the coarse variables for AMG. Classical AMG coarse set\
 construction relies on the strength of local algebraic connections between v\
ariables, that are often misleading and inaccurate. Alternatively, our coarse\
 set quality measure is the rate of convergence of compatible relaxation (CR)\
 [Brandt, ETNA, 2000]. It also leads to a construction algorithm of the coars\
e set. We will present numerical examples of our algorithm for simple model p\
roblems, e.g., anistropic diffusion and the biharmonic operator, for which cl\
assical AMG often fails. This work makes it possible to assess and construct \
a coarse set of variables for a given system, prior to its actual use by an A\
MG solver. Undergoing research is focused on attaining CR rates (that play a \
similar role to the smoothing rate in geometric multigrid, predicting the ide\
al multigrid efficiency). This relates to self-correcting AMG (a joint work w\

diffusive component offers a significant challenge because it is characterize\
d by a discontinuous diffusion coefficient with fine-scale anisotropic spatia\
l structure; moreover, the underlying grid may be severely distorted. Thus, i\
ncreasingly Mixed and Mixed-Hybrid discretizations (e.g., Support Operator Me\
thods, and Mixed-Hybrid finite element methods) are employed because they exp\
licitly enforce important physical properties of the problem, such as mass ba\
lance. However, these discretizations are based on the first order form, and \
hence, naturally lead to an indefinite linear system. Thus, the primary hurdl\

e to eliminate the flux (i.e., the vector unknowns) locally to obtain a spars\

 structure of this reduced system has posed a significant challenge for the d\
esign of efficient multigrid preconditioners. In this presentation we compare\
 two different approaches to preconditioning these systems. First, we conside\
r a mimetic approach to developing alternative or approximate discretizations\
 that generate reduced systems that have a sparsity structure amenable to exi\
sting robust multigrid solvers. In contrast, we consider the direct applicati\
on of variational coarsening, the robust but potentially costly technique tha\
t lies at the heart of most robust multigrid algorithms. Both of these techni\
ques have been used to generate a number of preconditioners for orthogonal gr\
ids, as well as distorted logically rectangular grids. We will discuss the va\
rying degrees of robustness associated with these preconditioners, as well as\
 their potential extension to unstructured grids. </html> ^J^J^J^J<hr><font s\

er> <p> Topology optimization is a relatively new field of structural mechani\
cs which tries to find an optimal design of a structure for a given load. One\
 flexible and advantageous FE based method is the so called SIMP approach (So\
lid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization for intermediate densities, c\
f. [1], [2]). In this approach the problem is reformulated to find an optimal\
 density distribution of the material in the domain. Therefore the optimizati\
on process leads to elasticity problems with large jumps in the material coef\
ficients and linear systems which become nearly singular so that classical it\
eration schemes for solving the linear systems provide only very poor converg\
ence. Since the accuracy of the approximate solution plays an essential role \
for the optimized design (solving the linear system with low accuracy leads o\
nly to suboptimal designs) direct methods are often used during the optimizat\
ion process which strictly limits the problem size.</br> To overcome this pro\
blem and accelerate the convergence of classical iteration schemes we propose\
 an algebraic multigrid preconditioner. Since algebraic multigrid methods can\
 deal with large jumps in the coefficient functions and complex geometries, t\
hey seem to be well fit for the linear systems occuring in the SIMP approach.\
 However, due to the fact that we have linear systems stemming from the discr\
etization of a system of PDEs and classical AMG methods are not well suited t\
o solve such systems efficiently, we use the so-called point-block approach [\
3]. We will describe the modifications of this method to obtain an efficient \
preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method in our optimization process.\
 At the end we will present some numerical results which underline the effici\
ency of the method for topology optimization. </br> </br> [1] Bendsoe MP "Opt\

> <p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> Poroelasticity has a wide range of\
 applications in biology, filtration and soil sciences. It represents a model\
 for problems where an elastic porous solid is saturated by a viscous fluid. \
The poroelasticity equations were derived by Biot, studying the consolidation\
 of soils. The equations have also been applied to the study of soft tissue c\
ompression to model the deformation and permeability of biological tissues. <\
br> We introduce an efficient multigrid method for the system of poroelastici\
ty equations. In particular, we present a pointwise smoothing method based on\
 distributive iteration. In distributive smoothing the original system of equ\
ations is transformed by post-conditioning in order to achieve favorable prop\
erties, such as a decoupling of the equations and/or possibilities for pointw\
ise smoothing. <br> A specialty lies in the discretization approach employed.\
 We adopt a so-called staggered grid for the poroelasticity equations, wherea\
s the usual way to discretize the equations is by means of finite elements. S\
tandard finite elements (or finite differences), however, do not lead to stab\
le solutions without additional stabilization. The staggered grid discretizat\
ion, as proposed in[3], leads to a natural stable discretization for the poro\
elasticity system. Staggering is a well-known discretization technique in com\
putational fluid dynamics, in particular for incompressible flow. The multigr\
id method is developed with analysis possibilities of increasing complexity o\
n the basis of Fourier analysis. After the analysis of the determinant of the\
 system of equations, the h-ellipticity concept is discussed, which is fundam\
ental for the existence of point smoothers. The smoother is developed based o\
n insights in distributive smoothers for Stokes and incompressible Navier-Sto\
kes equations [1,2,4,5]. It is evaluated and tuned with relaxation parameters\
 on the basis of Fourier smoothing analysis. An equation-wise decoupled smoot\
her with as principal operators simple Laplacian and biharmonic operators is \
obtained, although the blocks in the system of poroelasticitye equations cont\
ain anisotropies. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the method \
proposed. <br> [1] A. Brandt, Multigrid techniques: 1984 guide with applicati\

/center> <p> <center> <br> Abstract </center> <p> We study the applicability \
of Smoothed Aggregation Algebraic MultiGrid (SA-AMG) for oil reservoir simula\
tion problems. Previously, application of multigrid methods in reservoir simu\
lation focused on solving the scalar near-elliptic pressure equation, which i\
s obtained by the so-called IMPES (Implicit Pressure, Explicit Saturation) me\
thod. Here, we focus on linear systems with multiple degrees of freedom per g\
ridblock, or cell. These systems are Jacobean matrices obtained from fully im\
plicit discretization of the governing nonlinear species conservation equatio\
ns. We view the given discrete matrix problems as graphs, and we do not make \
any assumptions about the underlying structure of the grid. A preprocessing s\
tep, which manipulates the discrete system to yield an equation that resemble\
s the standard pressure equation, is performed. The result is a system of equ\
ations of mixed character; a pressure equation that is near elliptic, while t\
he remaining conservation equations are hyperbolic in the limit. All of our c\
omputations, including this preprocessing step, take advantage of the natural\
 block structure obtained by grouping the unknowns associated with a gridbloc\
k (i.e. vertex in the graph) together. Significant modifications to the compo\
nents that make up the SA-AMG algorithm were necessary to obtain good converg\
ence behavior. We experimented with several aggregation schemes. Aggregation \
of the cells, or gridblocks, based on a strong graph of the scalar pressure e\
quation yielded the best results, both in terms of robustness and convergence\
 rate. That is, variables associated with a gridblock other than the pressure\
 inherit the pressure-based choice of the aggregates. We report results using\
 different measures of strength to prune the full graph of the pressure equat\
ion. Not surprisingly, we also found it crucial to pay close attention to the\
 anisotropy. This was the case for the aggregation stage, the smoothing of ag\
gregation, and even the smoother used in the V-cycle. We describe a worm-like\
 aggregation algorithm designed to capture long-range strength of coupling. T\
his new aggregation scheme allows for aggressive coarsening, especially when \
the finest level (i.e. the given problem) possesses severe anisotropy. It is \
not uncommon for discretizations of three-dimensional reservoir simulation pr\
oblems to exhibit extreme preferential directional coupling. We obtained the \
best results when smoothing of interpolation was applied only to the pressure\
 coefficients. Attempts to improve the quality of the interpolation by applyi\
ng multiple smoothing steps proved ineffective. The results were sensitive to\
 the particular threshold for filtering the original matrix, and we use a dif\
ferent parameter to control that threshold. Finally, in conjunction with worm\
 aggregation, we employ block smoothing in the V-cycle, where the blocks are \
the cells (and their associated degrees of freedom) that make up an aggregate\
. We provide detailed performance results using several reservoir simulation \
examples that are of practical interest. </html> ^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+1">\

ocessing, pattern recognition, data compression, and biomedical technology. D\
ifferential approaches, which estimate velocity vectors from the spatial and \
temporal intensity derivatives are the most common visited techniques in the \
literature. The basic assumption behind that is the intensity variations are \
weak and only due to a movement in the image plan. <br> This constant brightn\
ess assumption leads to an ill-posed problem that can only be solved by impos\
ing additional assumptions. A standard technique, which is due to to Horn and\
 Schunck, is to require the flow field to be smooth by means of a standard re\
gularization approach. This results in a system of elliptic PDEs of reaction \
diffusion type. The second order terms are induced by the regularization and \
become straightforward Laplace operators. The zero order terms are linear (bu\
t variable) and are computed from the derivatives of the image data. Since th\
e image data (and even more so its derivatives) are usually nonsmooth, this p\
oses some nontrivial problems. The PDEs are usually discretized by standard f\
inite differences. <br> The Horn-Schuck algorithm is the standard way to disc\
retize and solve the PDEs. In multigrid terminology, it is simply a coupled p\
ointwise relaxation. As expected, it has acceptable convergence only if the z\
ero-order terms dominate but the performance is poor, when the diffusion char\
acter dominates. In this case, a multigrid strategy can be expected to provid\
e a significant accelleration by allowing a quick propagation of information \
from non-zero flow field regions into homogeneous or untextured image areas. \
The Horn-Schunck algorithm can still be used as a smoother for such a multigr\
id method. The most difficult aspect is to deal with the strongly discontinuo\
us coefficients in an efficient way. This will be discussed in our presentati\

e particularly interested in bioelectric field computations where the source \
terms are modeled by dipoles and where the computational goal is to locate di\
pole sources as accurately as possible from electroencephalographic measureme\
nts. <p> For analyzing the accuracy of such computations, standard techniques\
 cannot be used since they rely on global smoothness. This is both true for S\
obolev space arguments for finite element based methods, and for continuity a\
nd differentiability arguments in finite difference analysis. At the singular\
ity, the solution tends to infinity and therefore standard error norms will n\
ot even converge. <p> In this presentation we will demonstrate that these dif\
ficulties can be overcome by using other metrics to measure accuracy and conv\
ergence of the numerical solution. Only minor modifications to the discretiza\
tion and solver are necessary to obtain the same asymptotic accuracy and effi\
ciency as for regular and smooth solutions. In particular, no adaptive refine\
ment is necessary and it is also unnecessary to use techniques which make use\
 of the analytic knowledge of the singularity. Our method relies simply on a \
mesh-size dependent representation of the singular sources constructed by app\
ropriate smoothing. It can be proved that the pointwise accuracy is of the sa\
me order as in the regular case. The error coefficient depends on the locatio\
n and will deteriorate when approaching the singularity where the error estim\
ate breaks down. Our approach is therefore useful for accurately computing th\
e global solution, except in a small neighborhood of the singular points. In \
the talk we will demonstrate how these techniques can be integrated into a mu\
ltigrid solver exploiting additional techniques for improving the accuracy, s\

 of an algebraic multigrid scheme for real valued Maxwell problems. This real\
 valued method uses distributed relaxation and a specialized grid transfer op\

to complete the scheme a smoother must also be adapted to address the equival\
ent real form. We will show how application of the distributed relaxation ide\
a on the equivalent real form matrix leads to a nice decoupling of the proble\
m. To complete the method, complex polynomial smoothers are developed for use\
 within the distributed relaxation process. While some care is required to de\
velop the polynomials, they work well in parallel and avoid difficulties asso\

ergy minimization approach to constructing robust interpolation and restricti\
on operators for multigrid for solving convection dominated problems. Numeric\
al results for PDEs in 1D and 2D, in particular, entering flow and recirculat\
ing flow problems will be presented. <p> Multigrid for solving elliptic parti\
al differential equations (PDEs) with smooth coefficients has been proven, bo\
th numerically and theoretically, to be a successful and powerful techniques.\
 For PDEs whose coefficients are discontinuous or oscillatory, sophisticated \
interpolation techniques have been developed, for instance, algebraic multigr\
id, black box multigrid, etc. Recently, Wan, Chan and Smith proposed a robust\
 construction of interpolation operators by minimizing the energy norm of the\
 coarse grid basis functions subject to the constraint that the coarse grid b\
asis functions preserve the null space of the underlying PDE. Fast multigrid \
convergence is resulted for several types of nonsmooth coefficient elliptic P\
DEs on Cartesian as well as general triangular meshes. <p> In this talk, we e\
xtend the energy minimization approach to non-elliptic PDEs; specifically, co\
nvection diffusion equations. Since the discretization matrix is nonsymmetric\
 in general, the energy norm induced by the symmetric positive definite matri\
x in the case of elliptic PDEs no longer applicable. In other words, one cann\
ot simply take the matrix and construct energy minimizing basis function usin\
g the induced matrix norm. Our idea is to construct two sets of basis functio\
ns, one by minimizing the energy norm of the elliptic operator, and the other\
 set by minimizing the L2 norm, subject to appropriate constraints. In this w\
ay, the norms are well-defined so that norm minimization makes sense. More im\
portantly, we can capture the elliptic and hyperbolic parts of the underlying\
 PDE by these two set of basis functions. Then they are used in defining the \
interpolation and restriction operators for multigrid. Numerical results for \
solving the entering and recirculating flow problems are presented to demonst\
rate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ^J^J^J^J<hr><font size="+1">\

Multi coloring techniques are difficult to implement and can be inefficient, \
if too many colors are involved, which is often the case on the coarser level\
s on AMG. Hybrid schemes use a sequential smoother on each processor, but upd\
ate in a Jacobi like fashion across processor boundaries, and therefore often\
 have similar disadvantages as Jacobi like smoothers. <p> In this talk, we in\
vestigate the use of relaxation parameters in hybrid smoothers. We analyze th\
eir influence on the smoothing property, describe a procedure that automatica\
lly determines good parameters on each level of AMG and present numerical res\
ults that show significant improvement over AMG with unrelaxed hybrid smoothe\
rs. <p> *This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of\

ER> <p> Robust multigrid algorithms for linear boundary-value problems are we\
ll-researched. For nonlinear problems, two general approaches are used widely\
: Global Linearization (GL) and Local Linearization (LL). In the GL approach,\
 e.g., Newton's method, the discretized problem is linearized and the resulti\
ng linear system is solved approximately by a (robust) linear multigrid algor\
ithm. This is repeated iteratively. In the LL approach, the nonlinear fine-gr\
id operator is approximated nonlinearly on the coarser grids, and explicit li\
nearization is only performed locally, in the relaxation process. The best kn\
own of the LL methods is the so-called FAS (Full Approximation Scheme). For s\
imple problems, the two approaches often perform similarly, but a distinct be\
havior is exhibited in more complicated situations, with the GL approach perf\
orming better in some cases and the LL approach in others. We propose a Multi\
level Nonlinear Method (MNM) which is designed to be at least as robust as ei\
ther one of the classical approaches and often more robust than both. A heuri\
stic analysis, supported by numerical experiments, suggests that MNM indeed y\
ields superior convergence behavior for difficult nonlinear problems. ^J^J^J\

udy of an energy minimizing basis first introduced by Chan, Smith and Wan in \
2000 for algebraic multigrid methods. The basis will be first obtained in an \
explicit and compact form in terms of certain local and global operators. The\
 basis functions are then proven to be locally homonic functions on each coar\
se grid ``elememt''. Using these new results, it is illustrated that this bas\
is can be numerically obtained in an optimal fashion. In addition to the inte\
nded application for algebaric multigrid method, the energy minimizing basis \
may also be applied for numerical homogenization. </html>^J^J^J^J<hr><font si\

bspace invariant have been proven to be appropriate smoothers for multigrid m\
ethods. The Braess-Sarazin smoother for saddle point problems belongs to this\
 class, where the invariant subspace is the kernel of the operator describing\
 the constraints. Performing one step of this iterative method, however, requ\
ires the accurate solution of some global linear system for the dual variable\
s. Another iterative method with invariant subspace has been proposed by Joac\
him Schoeberl for parameter dependent elliptic problems and the limiting sadd\
le point problem. If this smoother is accompanied with some specific (kernel-\
preserving) prolongation robust multigrid convergence results were shown by S\
choeberl. The smoother as well as the prolongation can be realized by solving\
 a number of local problems. In this talk it will be shown that multigrid con\
vergence can also be achieved for standard prolongation and local kernel--pre\
serving smoothers for saddle point problems. </html>^J^J^J^J</body>^J</html>\
